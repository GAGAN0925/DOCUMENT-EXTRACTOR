The Greeks mention the\nexistence of cities and fortified towns such as Taxila. Arrian mentions that after defeating\nPorus, Alexander marched eastwards towards the Chena River, and captured 37 towns: the\nsmallest of these towns had 5,000 or more inhabitants. Inthe Swat valley, Alexander i said to\nIhave seized 230,000 oxen (possibly Zebu), intending to send them to Macedonia\nfor ploughing land. Aristobulus saw rice being grown in paddy fields, Onesicrtus reported the\nexistence ofa crop called bosmoran (possibly the peal millet), and Nearchus wrote of \"honey-\nyielding reeds\u201d (presumably the sugarcane), Nearchus also mentions that Indians wore clothes\nmade of cotton, Rock salt was extracted from the Salt Range, and supplied to other parts of\nIndia. Some primitive communities existed in the forest, desert, and coastal regions of the\nsubcontinent. For example, Nearchus mentions that people around the Tomeros river (Hingol)\nsubsisted on fishing, and used stone tools instead of iron ones.\n\n\u2018The Greek writers mention the priestly class of Brahmanas (as \"Brachmanes\"), who are\ndescribed as teachers of Indian philosophy. They do not reer tothe existence of any religious\ntemples or idols in India, although such references commonly occur in their descriptions of\n\u2018Alexander's campaigns in Egypt, Mesopotamia and Iran. Greek accounts mention naked\nascetics called gymnosophists. A philosopher named Calanus (probably a Greek transcription\nOf the Indian name \"Kalyana\u201d) aecompanied Alexander to Persepolis, where he committed\nsuicide on a public funeral pyre: he was probably a Jain or an Ajivika monk, There is no\nreference to Buddhism in the Greek accounts,\n\nOther than their mention of the Brahmanas, the Greek narratives about Alexander\u2019 invasion\ndo not directly mention the caste system, Some Bralmanas acted as advisors to local princes:\n\u2018Alexander had groups of Brahmanas hanged in present-day Sindh for instigating the rulers\nMusicanus and Sambus to revolt against him. The Greek writings attest the existence of slavery\nin at least two places: Onesicrtus describes slavery in the teritory ruled by Musicanus, and\nAristobulus mentions poor people selling their daughters publicly in Taxila, Aristobulus also\n\u2018observed Sati, the practice of widows immolating themselves on their husbands\u2019 pyre, at Taxila\n\u2018The practice of exposing dead bodies 10 vultures, similar to the Magian practice of Tower of\nSilence, was also prevalent in Taxila, Nearchus mentions that Indians weote letters on closely\nwoven cloth; it is possible that this i a reference to a precursor ofthe Kharoshthi script, which\nmay have developed from the Aramaic alphabet during the Achaemenid rule. While describing\n\u2018a tribe on the coast of present-day Balochistan, Neurchus mentions that they were different\nfrom Indians in \u201ctheir language and customs\", which implies that he associated a particular\nlanguage with the Indians.\" This does not mean that the Indians spoke a single language: the\nlanguage that Nearchus associated with India might have been a lingua franca used for oficial\nand commercial purposes. This lingua franca was most probably the Gandhari Prakrit, as the\nGreek names (e-g. \"Taxila\" and \"Sandrokottus\") for Indian people and places seem to be\nderived from this language (e.g. \"Takhasila\u201d and \"Chandagutta\u201d) rather than Sanskrit (\u00a2.\n\"Takshashila\u201d and \"Chandragupta\u201d)\n\nNearchus attests the existence of medical science in India: he mentions that when the Greek\nphysicians failed to provide remedies for snake-bites to Alexander, the king gathered Indian\nhealers who were also able to cure other diseases and painful conditions. The Greek accounts\n\u2018do not mention any other sciences of contemporary India\n"
