Before crossing to Asia, Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders and, inthe spring
of 335 BC, he advanced into Thrace to deal with the revolt, which was led by
the Hyrians and Triballi, At Mount Haemus, the Macedonian army attacked and defeated a
‘Thracian garrison manning the heights. The Macedonians were then attacked inthe rear by the
‘Triballi, who were crushed in turn, Alexander then advanced on to the Danube, encountering
the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. The Getae army retreated after the first cavalry skirmish,
leaving their town to the Macedonian army. News then reached Alexander that Cletus, King
of Ilyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulantit were in open revolt against Macedonian
authority. Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing Cleitus and Glaukias to flee with their
armies, leaving Alexander's northern frontier secure.

‘While he was triumphantly campaigning north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once more.
Alexander reacted immediately, but, while the other cities once again hesitated, Thebes decided
to resist with the utmost vigor. This resistance was useless, however, as the city was razed t0
the ground amid great bloodshed and its territory divided between the other Boeotian cities.
‘The end of Thebes cowed Athens into submission, leaving all of Greece at least outwardly at
peace with Alexander

Alexander the Great crosses the Hellespont and begins his campaign in the East. Alexander
the Great entered history for eternity on this day, April 1, in 334 BC when he crossed the
Hellespont and began his campaign inthe East agains the Persian Empire, and later an invasion
of India

Socio-political conditions in India

Alexander's incursion into India was limited fo the Indus River basin area, which was divided
‘among several small states. These states appear to have been bused on dominance of particular
tribes, as the Greek writers mention tribes such as the Malloi as well as kings whose names
seem to be tribal designations. The Achaemenid Empire of Persia had held suzerainty over the
Indus valley in the previous decades, but there was no trace of Achaemenid rule beyond the
Indus river when Alexander's army artived inthe region. Strabo, sourcing his information from
the earlier writer Eratosthenes, states that the Achaemenid king controlled the area to the west
of the Indus. This area (including the Kapisa-Gandhara region) was probably the territory of

states that were under the hegemony of Macedonia in order to combat the Achaemenid
Empire,

News of Philip's death roused many states into revolt, including Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, as
Well as the Thracian tibes to the north of Macedon. When news of the revolt reached
‘Alexander, he took quick action. Although his advisers recommended the use of diplomacy.

‘Alexander ignored the advice and instead proceeded to muster together his Macedonian
cavalry of 3.000 men, Together, the army rode south towards Thessaly (Macedon's immediate
neighbor to the south). When he found the Thessalian army blocking the pass between Mount
‘Olympus and Mount Ossa, he had his men ride over Mount Ossa. When the Thessalians awoke,

they found Alexander at their rear. The Thessalians quickly surrendered, and their cavalry was
‘added to Alexander's force. He then proceeded south, towards the Peloponnese. Alexander
stopped at Thermopylae, where he was recognized as the leader of the Sacred League before
heading south to Corinth. Athens sued for peace and Alexander received the envoy and
pardoned anyone involved with the uprising. At Corinth, he was given the ttle ‘Hegemon’ of
the Greek forces against the Persians. Whilst at Corinth, he heard the news of a Thracian
uprising in the north.

the Indians, who according to the Geek accounts, fought alongside their overiord Darks Ii at
the Battle of Gaugamela

Greek writings as well as archaeological excavations indicate the existence of an urban
economy dependent on agriculture and trade in the Indus basin. The Greeks mention the
existence of cities and fortified towns such as Taxila. Arrian mentions that after defeating
Porus, Alexander marched eastwards towards the Chena River, and captured 37 towns: the
smallest of these towns had 5,000 or more inhabitants. Inthe Swat valley, Alexander i said to
Ihave seized 230,000 oxen (possibly Zebu), intending to send them to Macedonia
for ploughing land. Aristobulus saw rice being grown in paddy fields, Onesicrtus reported the
existence ofa crop called bosmoran (possibly the peal millet), and Nearchus wrote of "honey-
yielding reeds” (presumably the sugarcane), Nearchus also mentions that Indians wore clothes
made of cotton, Rock salt was extracted from the Salt Range, and supplied to other parts of
India. Some primitive communities existed in the forest, desert, and coastal regions of the
subcontinent. For example, Nearchus mentions that people around the Tomeros river (Hingol)
subsisted on fishing, and used stone tools instead of iron ones.

‘The Greek writers mention the priestly class of Brahmanas (as "Brachmanes"), who are
described as teachers of Indian philosophy. They do not reer tothe existence of any religious
temples or idols in India, although such references commonly occur in their descriptions of
‘Alexander's campaigns in Egypt, Mesopotamia and Iran. Greek accounts mention naked
ascetics called gymnosophists. A philosopher named Calanus (probably a Greek transcription
Of the Indian name "Kalyana”) aecompanied Alexander to Persepolis, where he committed
suicide on a public funeral pyre: he was probably a Jain or an Ajivika monk, There is no
reference to Buddhism in the Greek accounts,

Other than their mention of the Brahmanas, the Greek narratives about Alexander’ invasion
do not directly mention the caste system, Some Bralmanas acted as advisors to local princes:
‘Alexander had groups of Brahmanas hanged in present-day Sindh for instigating the rulers
Musicanus and Sambus to revolt against him. The Greek writings attest the existence of slavery
in at least two places: Onesicrtus describes slavery in the teritory ruled by Musicanus, and
Aristobulus mentions poor people selling their daughters publicly in Taxila, Aristobulus also
‘observed Sati, the practice of widows immolating themselves on their husbands’ pyre, at Taxila
‘The practice of exposing dead bodies 10 vultures, similar to the Magian practice of Tower of
Silence, was also prevalent in Taxila, Nearchus mentions that Indians weote letters on closely
woven cloth; it is possible that this i a reference to a precursor ofthe Kharoshthi script, which
may have developed from the Aramaic alphabet during the Achaemenid rule. While describing
‘a tribe on the coast of present-day Balochistan, Neurchus mentions that they were different
from Indians in “their language and customs", which implies that he associated a particular
language with the Indians." This does not mean that the Indians spoke a single language: the
language that Nearchus associated with India might have been a lingua franca used for oficial
and commercial purposes. This lingua franca was most probably the Gandhari Prakrit, as the
Greek names (e-g. "Taxila" and "Sandrokottus") for Indian people and places seem to be
derived from this language (e.g. "Takhasila” and "Chandagutta”) rather than Sanskrit (¢.
"Takshashila” and "Chandragupta”)

Nearchus attests the existence of medical science in India: he mentions that when the Greek
physicians failed to provide remedies for snake-bites to Alexander, the king gathered Indian
healers who were also able to cure other diseases and painful conditions. The Greek accounts
‘do not mention any other sciences of contemporary India

‘The Indian campaign of Alexander the Great began in 327 BC and lasted until 325 BC.
‘Afier conquering the Achaemenid Persian Empire, the Macedonian army undertook an
expedition into the Indian subcontinent. Within two years, Alexander expanded
the Macedonian Empire to include present-day Punjab and Sindh in what is Modern-
day Pakistan, surpassing the earlier frontiers that had been established by the Persian conquest
of the Indus Valley.

Following Macedon's absorption of Gandhara (a former Persian satrapy), including the city
of Taxila, Alexander and his troops advanced into Punjab, where they were confronted
byPorus, the regional Indian king. In 326 BC, Alexander defeated Porus and
the Pauravas during the Battle of the Hydaspes, but that engagement was possibly their
Macedonians’ most costly bate.

‘Alexander's continued eastward march was leading his army into a confrontation with
the Nanda Empire, based in Magadha. According to Greek sources, the Nanda army was five
times the size of the Macedonian army: Alexander's troops—increasingly exhausted,
homesick, and anxious by the prospects of having o further face large Indian armies throughout
the Indo-Gangetic Plain —mutinied at the Hyphasis River, refusing to advance his push to the
cast. After a meeting with his army general Coenus, during which he was informed of his
soldiers’ laments, Alexander relented under the conviction that it was better to return, He
subsequently tuned southward, advancing through southern Punjab as well as Sindh, where he
conquered more tribes along the lower areas ofthe Indus River, before finally turning westward
to reach Macedon,

‘There are no ancient sources at all giving an Indian account of the campaign, or even
mentioning it at all. There is no mention of Porus inthe extremely sparse Indian accounts of
the period. There are however Indian literary accounts and Indian folktales, possibly written
many years later. Of those who accompanied Alexander to India, Aristobulus, Onesiritus,
‘and Neurchus wrote about the Indian campaign. The only surviving contemporary account of
‘Alexander's Indian campaign isa report of the voyage ofthe naval commander Nearchus, who
was tasked with exploring the coast between the Indus River and the Persian Gulf. This report
is preserved in Arrian’s Anabasis (c.1S0 AD). Arrian provides a detailed account of
‘Alexander's campaigns, based on the writings of Alexander's companions and courtiers.
‘Arrian’s account is supplemented by the writings of other authors, whose works are also based
fon the accounts of Alexander's companions: these authors include Diodorus (e. 21
BC), Strabo (¢.23 AD), and Plutarch (e. 119 AD),
