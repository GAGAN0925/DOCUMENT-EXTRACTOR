Very\nsoon he realized the need for social and national integration of the numerous cultures\nhe ruled. The Macedonian king applied extensive policies on creating common\ncultural points of reference for the political and cultural heterogeneous nations he\ncontrolled by using common language, common currency and common traditions,\nWithout, however, to uproot the individual characteristies of each of them\n\n\u2018This model for Alexander's administration of his vast empire was based on\nPhilip\u2019s IL political experimentations in northern Greece, and in its turn this was\ninspired by the Persian system of administration.
