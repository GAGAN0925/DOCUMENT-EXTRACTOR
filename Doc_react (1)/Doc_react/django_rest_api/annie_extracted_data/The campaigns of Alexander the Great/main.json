Far too many people have helped with\nits production to be named individually, but some are deserving of special praise. Firstly\nHans Van Wees for agreeing to be the external examiner on this thesis, and for his\nencouragement after performing the same role on my MA thesis in 2002, and\nencouraging me towards continuing studies.\n\nI would also like to thank Elizabeth, for being wonderful; for putting up with me,\nand for her constant support and encouragement in our life together. My thanks also to\nmy parents for their encouragement over the long years; and my brother, John, for his\ntireless and I\u2019m happy to say, free, IT support. I must also mention Martin and Sue\nFoulkes; Sue for her boundless enthusiasm and encouragement and Martin for his help\nand guidance as a study partner during our seven years together in Durham University.\n\nMy greatest thanks are reserved, however, for Professor Peter Rhodes; for over a\ndecade since 1997 Peter has been my lecturer, tutor, supervisor, mentor and for my part at\nleast, friend. His kindness and patience and academic expertise have been limitless and\ninvaluable to me over that time, truly I would not have achieved anywhere near the level\naf anndamin cumnacna that Tbncren ewe tle mech beeen\n"

The study of\nfighting is, unfortunately, no longer fashionable; it is somewhat appropriate and\nsatisfying that I complete this work exactly 50 years after Fuller wrote his \u201cgeneralship\u201d.\nModern historians have tended to focus more on the wider context of warfare, and on\nAlexander\u2019s character.

Option two is a strong theme throughout the thesis; both in terms\nof numbers and tactical reconstructions. At the Granicus, for example, I think the most\nmilitarily probable theory, based upon what we know of Alexander\u2019s tactics elsewhere,\nand the fact that we have to completely different accounts, is that both are correct and\nneed to be reconciled into a single coherent theory, as I have tried to do. Option three is\npossible on occasions, particularly with regard to the pezhetairoi. We know there were\n1500 men per taxis, so if three taxeis are mentioned we can reasonably assume that 4500\nheavy infantry were present. This argument hardly ever works for the Persian order of\nbattle as we have less general knowledge of the command structure. My own option four\nis applicable in some instances: for example the only reason we know there were 3000\nnypaspists is that their three taxeis take up the same frontage as two taxeis of pezhetairoi,\n"

This will be partly based upon the tactics\ndemonstrated in other encounters, and bears great fruit with the career of Alexander as he\nwas such a successful recycler of tactics and strategies. By using this principle we can\nreasonably speculate that Arrian, for example, may be correct in some elements of his\nnarrative, Curtius etc. in others. This principle should be used as a last resort when other,\nmore academically rigorous methods have failed, as we have two separate and\nincompatible pictures of events, or with points of fine detail.

The expense alone would have been\nprohibitive, especially early in Alexander\u2019s reign when we know that gold was scarce. If Markle is correct\nthat the Macedonians were not always equipped with the sarissa then two possibilities present themselves:\neither thousands of panoplies of armour (shields, spear etc.) were made and transported all across Asia\n(which I do not believe) or only spears were transported (the logistics of this would have been relatively\nsimple, certainly compared to transporting full panoplies of hoplite equipment. If this is the case then\nduring the set-piece battles where the sarissa was not used the Macedonians would have been equipped in\nthe same way in terms of defensive equipment, and would have carried a hoplite spear. During occasions\nwhere hoplite shields were required and the mercenaries and allies were not employed (e.g. here) the\nshields could have been commandeered and returned after use. Thousands of panoplies would not have\nbeen required as not all of the heavy infantry would have been able to operate in such a limited space as in\nthis pass.\n\n7 Tf this theory is correct, and I suspect that on occasion the pezhetairoi were equipped as regular hoplites,\nI would add that the sarissa was unlikely to have been used at the Hydaspes either, given the difficult night\ntime river crossing.\n28 Arrian 1.2.1.\n'29 Bosworth, 1980, 56; Papazoglu, 1978, 30-31; although Green, 1991, 127 seems more confident\nidentifying it as the River Yantra and Hammond, 1980b, 46 identifies it with the Rositsa.\n\nAerwinn 199\n"

A\nfuller explanation is given in my tentative new theory presented at the end of this chapter.\n\nThe infantry taxis mentioned above is also unusual. Berve\u00ae\u201d and Badian*\u201d both\nidentified it with a chiliarchy of hypaspists, but it is widely known that the term taxis is\nelastic and was often used to describe any infantry unit, even light infantry.\u00b0 With this\nin mind, and noting the proximity of the archers and Agrianians, it is likely that one of\nthese two groups was the taxis in question; both of which were eminently more suited to\nthis type of action than the heavy infantry. Harl assumed this unit of infantry to be the\nheavy infantry taxis stationed immediately to the left of the hypaspists, that of Perdiccas.\nThis makes little sense, however, as it would mean the troops stationed on the extreme\nright were advancing whilst the hypaspists, who were better suited for this kind of action,\nremained stationary; and Perdiccas\u2019 unit, to the left of the hypaspists, was attacking\nupstream to the right, across the path of any potential assault by the hypaspists. This\nwould have the effect of removing Alexander\u2019s best infantry from the battle.\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\n\nIt would seem from Arrian\u2122 that almost immediately after the Amyntas/Socrates\nattack was launched, Alexander himself charged into the river. Arrian also tells us that\nAlexander kept his line oblique to the pull of the current to prevent a flank attack and to\nensure as solid a front as possible as they emerged from the water. The banks were steep\nin places,\u00b0\u00ae and only easily climbed where the gravel beds descend to the river on either\nside. It is unlikely that any two of these gravel beds faced each other so a diagonal\ncrossing was forced upon Alexander. The text reads as though the army filtered over the\nriver in something of a continuous line, moving towards the right. But the Greek seems to\nrom as \u201cin the direction the stream drew them\u201d, which is to say downstream, to the\nelt.\n"

In the ancient world, warships could not carry any great quantity of supplies\nand so had to dock at a friendly port every night to re-supply with food and fresh water. It\nis also true that this strategy ultimately worked; the Persian fleet did collapse as\nAlexander captured key cities on the Phoenician coast, but the strategy had at least two\nserious flaws. The first was that a competent commander, as Memnon surely was, had a\nfree hand to act as he wished in the Aegean, to overrun all of the islands and carry the\nfight to the mainland, where several states would more than likely have revolted given the\nopportunity. Secondly it does not take any account of the fact that a significant portion of\nthe Persian fleet was from Cyprus, which would theoretically have been unaffected by\nAlexander\u2019s strategy; although these ships would still have needed mainland ports in\norder to operate, they would still be loyal to the Persians and able to harass Alexander\u2019s\nsupply lines. Alexander essentially relied upon luck to overcome these two problems,\nwhich was uncharacteristic. His planning was usually far more meticulous than this and\nhis strategies were well thought out; which leads me to conclude that his decision here\nwas not a purely tactical or strategic one, but something else.\n"

In contrast to\nAlexander\u2019s shortcomings, Memnon and Ephialtes showed themselves to be commanders\nof the highest order. Memnon successfully sealed breaches in the walls where they\noccurred, he constructed a huge tower from which to shower the attackers with missiles\nand he conducted a series of sorties that always had Alexander on the back foot whilst\nEphialtes led the first sortie with distinction. With hindsight Alexander was certainly\nsuccessful in the capture of Halicarnassus, and it did not take too long, for which he\nshould be congratulated; we can also say that he learned tough lessons from his mistakes\nhere that he was to put into practice during later sieges (i.e. Tyre and Gaza).

Not to follow that strategy until this point\nseems incredible, and a very significant mistake. The lack of a fleet made during the\ninitial stages of the siege made the tactic impossible, of course, and it is probably an\nexample of Alexander\u2019s arrogance that he attempted to capture the city essentially by\nbrute force. The failure to defend the mole properly is also a mistake, his impatience to\nblame there; he evidently believed that taking the time to build abatis along the edges of\nthe mole and to properly protect the towers would have slowed progress that was already\nproceeding too slowly for Alexander\u2019s liking. It is sobering, however, that this failure\nresulted in far greater delays than if he had taken proper precautions initially.\n\nCurtius presents us with a picture of a depressed Alexander, a man undecided\nwhether to continue with the siege, or to abandon it;?\u201d his decision to stay only coming\nwith the arrival of the Cyprian fleet. This is almost certainly another instance of Curtius\nmisunderstanding his sources. It is likely that Alexander considered leaving, but not that\nhe considered abandoning the siege. The history of his career tells us that he could never\nadmit that he had been beaten, and thus Tyre had to fall. I see little reason to doubt,\nhowever, that Alexander himself considered leaving the siege, perhaps with Perdiccas in\ncharge, and continuing the advance towards Egypt. Alexander was a man of action and\nsitting for several months while the mole was constructed without being able to engage\nthe enemy at all would have been unbelievably frustrating for him. We do have an\nexample of a similar action, the siege of Halicarnassus; here Alexander left before the\nfinal fall of the city to continue the campaign, leaving some troops behind to complete the\ncapture. There may well have been discussions along these lines which Curtius confused.\n"

The most\nplausible figures, however, are those provided by Curtius: 200,000 infantry and 45,000\ncavalry are not unreasonable numbers; given that this was to be Darius\u2019 last stand and\nthat he had had around two years to prepare, summoning contingents from what remained\nof his empire. Devine,''\" in attempting a slight defence of Arrian, proposes the\nbelievable hypothesis that Arrian\u2019s 40,000 cavalry may have been a paper strength,\nalthough it was never actually achieved. This in itself is plausible enough, but it is a\nnumber unfortunately juxtaposed against the 1,000,000 infantry, which has to be pure\n"

It is inconceivable that Alexander, when faced with the choice of\nattacking the flanking troops or attacking the Great King, would have steered away from\nDarius. We can further argue that Alexander\u2019s whole tactic was to attack the Persian\ncentre from two directions simultaneously, and with the heavy infantry either engaged, or\nabout to engage the Persian centre, he could not afford a delay in mopping up the Persian\nleft, if the battle was to be won.

There had been a large influx from Greece, but they were left behind to ensure\nthat there were no further difficulties in Sogdiana and Bactria.'\u2019\u2019' The organisation of the\narmy had also changed to make it more mobile and able to respond to changing\ncircumstances: the pezhetairoi had all but abandoned the sarissa; its use is not recorded\nagain in the sources.

This figure should be increased: the full host and baggage train was not present,\nnut that is surely more than negated by the weather, the muddy ground and unknown\nerrain involved. A 29km night march in the conditions described in the sources would be\nchallenging; a long night march coupled with a difficult river crossing for 9,000 infantry\nund 5,300 cavalry stretches credulity, especially when we consider an equally long march\no Porus\u2019 camp and two battles also to be fought. With this in mind I would propose that\nAlexander marched to the crossing point and waited in the forests and gullies of the area;\nrence their prominence in Arrian\u2019s descriptions, and their importance to Alexander in the\nselection of the crossing point.

We must ask the simple question, why would the Indian right wing move, or be\nordered to move, in support of the Indian left it they were standing opposite a significant\nbody of enemy cavalry? This would quite simply be courting disaster by inviting the\nflanking attack that Alexander so coveted. The answer is simply that they would not, so\nsomething else must have occurred. I believe that Coenus was initially stationed with\nAlexander on the Macedonian right, but was ordered to circle around the right flank of\nthe Indian army once the Indian cavalry had begun to move. Arrian\u2019s use of Wp Ex/could\nrefer to this; whilst it was not specifically a feint attack as he did not engage the enemy,\nhe was simply being kept away from the area of the line that he was assigned to attack\nuntil the most opportune moment. As far as the Indians were concerned, all of\nAlexander\u2019s cavalry were concentrated against their left and thus reinforcing this sector\nwith cavalry from the right that were not engaged was a sensible strategy; it is\nunfortunate for Porus that this was exactly what Alexander\u2019s strategy required.\n\nHamilton and Tarn both discussed, at length, the movement of the Indian\ncavalry;'\u2122 Tarn'6! speculated that the Indian move was an offensive one, that Porus had\nseen an opportunity to defeat Alexander himself at a time when he only commanded two\nhipparchies and the agema. This hypothesis would presuppose a terrible risk if we\nassume that Coenus was already on the Macedonian left, or moving towards it, as noted\nabove. Hamilton\u2019s'\u00ae\"\u2019 suggestion is far more sensible: the presence of a large body of\nMacedonian cavalry on the Indian left forced Porus to reinforce that sector; the move was\nthus fundamentally defensive and caused not by a perceived weakness, but as a counter to\nAlexander\u2019s superiority in numbers. If we look at the battle from Porus\u2019 point of view for\na moment, and apply the flanking tactics that Alexander was so fond of, Porus was\npresented with a golden opportunity to attack the Macedonian heavy infantry in the flank\nor rear; something that Alexander would certainly have done while expecting his\noutnumbered cavalry'*? to hold their position long enough for the battle to be won. As\nnoted, however, Porus\u2019 strategy was fundamentally defensive, and thus the cavalry\nmoved to reinforce the Indian left. Even after the detachment of Coenus, Alexander\nwould have perhaps 3,000 cavalry and the Indians 2,000;'\u00a2\"\u00b0 hardly an overwhelming\ndisadvantage for the Indians, and yet still they chose to reinforce this sector. I would\ncount this as Porus\u2019 biggest mistake in the entire battle; failing to take the opportunity for\na flanking attack, and choosing a defensive posture automatically. Porus was essentially\nputting total faith in the ability of his elephants to defeat the Macedonian centre, a battle\nthat had not yet even been joined.\n"

I have argued earlier\u2019 that on occasion, as in\nthe Shipka Pass, the Macedonians were occasionally equipped as regular hoplites having\nfirst commandeered the shields of the mercenaries and allies (who were not employed\nthen and probably not here either). I\u2019m not convinced that Alexander would have\n>quipped his heavy infantry with the hoplite shield here as the night crossing of a river in\nspate would be difficult enough with the small shield, doubly so with a larger one. If the\ninfantry were still equipped with the pelta then the order reported by Arrian is simply a\nreference to forming in the most compact formation available, not literally to \u201clock\nshields\u201d. Following the same argument as used with the shield, I am not convinced that\nthe sarissa was used at the Hydaspes for much the same reason. The sarissa is not\nspecifically mentioned at the Hydaspes by any source, and indeed it is not mentioned at\nall after Gaugamela. For the Hydaspes I believe the infantry were equipped with the pelta\nand hoplite spear which I argued earlier would have been carried with the army in great\nnumbers for just such an occasion.\n"

This is again a\nstrategy that was employed at every opportunity, and is one of the key reasons for\nAlexander\u2019s consistent success. Alexander realised that no matter how well trained his\narmy was, it was always massively outnumbered, and that his infantry were not hoplites\nand thus not suited to a simple hoplite-style battle. If the enemy stood up to the initial\nshock of the sarissa attack, the tide would quickly turn against them if the battle was\nprolonged. We do indeed see the Macedonian infantry hard pressed at Issus and\nGaugamela precisely because the battle lasted longer than Alexander would have liked.\nAlexander deployed the flanking attack strategy for a number of reasons: it shortened\nbattles, and both reduced the possibility of the heavy infantry breaking and increased\ntheir shock potential as they knew they did not usually have to fight for long. Flanking\nattacks against the enemy also routed them far more rapidly then an unsophisticated\nfrontal assault, thus ensuring a more rapid and guaranteed victory. Shortening the battle\nalso led to fewer casualties; a vital consideration as Alexander moved further and further\naway from Macedonia and easy replacements. The supreme example of the flanking\nattack during the career of Alexander is at Issus; Alexander planned a whole series of\nbrilliantly conceived and executed flanking movements that devastated the Persian host\nand gave Alexander a rapid and decisive victory with an apparently small loss of life on\n"

Flanking\nttacks were used, for example, at Tyre and Gaza to prevent the enemy from\nconcentrating their defence against the sector where Alexander expected to break\nhrough. Even during sieges, Alexander was able to draw the enemy onto ground of his\nhoosing, as at Sanagala: where the defenders chose initially to engage Alexander outside\nhe city, Alexander retreated to a nearby hill to draw them away from their city ensuring\nnore would be slaughtered as they fled after the inevitable defeat.
