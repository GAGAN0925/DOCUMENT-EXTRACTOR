Ihave done my best to put the\nsame kind of pictures used in the Kindle version.\n\nAs for citing, there is nothing I ean do for that unless I stumble across the same wording.

Drawing on what he saw, he used the formation known as the Theban wedge\n\u2018or echelon, This wedge consisted of protruding columns arrayed up to 50 shields deep. This proved\nto bea devastating weapon. Philip changed the weaponry from a hoplite spear to sarissa, an 18-t0-\n20-fo0t pike, over twice the length ofthe traditional weapons. It had the advantage of having at\nleast four spear points protruding in front of the front shield, No contemporary hoplit armies were\nable to cope with these changes. The sarissa head alone measured two feet and sliced through\nshields and armor-like swords attached to hardwood poles. The opposing hoplite whose shield was\ntransfixed and dislocated by one sarissa soon found himself bloodied by another.\n\nPhilip also changed the helmets, redesigned the shield, and each man also received a smaller\ndouble-edged sword called a xiphos for hand-to-hand combat.

Tyre was a stronghold for the Persian fleet and leaving them behind would\n\u2018threaten Alexander's rear.

In Bactria, which is modem\n\u2018Afghanistan the mountain campaign meant that no large battle was possible, instead Alexander\nhhad to conduct a series of smaller campaigns, which took three years to finally subdue the area\nUsing the speed and discipline developed over the years of campaigns, Alexander split his army\n\u2018and under the conteol of suecessful generals gradually subdued the area, After a number of sieges,\nBessus was betrayed to Alexander, who after placing him on the roadside naked, in chains and\nwearing a wooden collar, had him mutilated and executed, Also during the campaign, Alexander\n\u2018married Barsine, a Bactrian princess who was reported to be the most beautiful woman in Asia,\n\n\u2018While on the Bactrian campaigns there was a plot on Alexanders life known as the Philotas\nconspiracy. A Macedonian noble, Dimnus conspired to kill Alexander and confided this with his\nlover Nicomachus. However, when Nicomachus told his brother Cebalinus, Cebalinus had to warn\n\u2018Alexander. He came across Philotas, the son of Parmenion and told him. Philotas, however\nignored the warning, thinking that it was not serious. Cebalinus continued to try and get his\nwarning to Alexander and once he did, both Dimnus and Philotas were arrested\n\nDimnus managed to kill himself before tral but Philotas, a boyhood friend of Alexander, but\nwho was unpopular with other senior Macedonians was found guilty and murdered. Alexander\n\u2018knew this would infuriate Parmenion who was in charge of a large army\u2019 and financial reserves in\nEebatana. Taking no chances, a messenger was dispatched with great haste and Parmenion was\nexecuted.\n\nAt the star of 326BC, with Bactria finally secure, Alexander wanted to continue on his\n\u2018campaign to the ends of the world; oss the Indus River and beyond into modern India, This was\nfurther than\u201d the Persians had ever gone. Alexander crossed the Indus River in May into the\nKingdom of Taxiles, who surrendered to him, so they continued on until they ran into an Indian\nking, Porus who instead of welcoming the Macedonians drew up on the east bank of the Hydaspes|\nRiver with a force of 30,000 infantry, 4.000 cavalry and 200 war elephants.\n\n\u201cBed this sentence make bee sense.

Alexander himself martied Staeira I, the eldest\ndaughter of Darius, and, according to Aristobulus, another wife in addition, Parysatis 11, the\nyoungest daughter of Artaxerxes IIL\u201d\n\n\u2018To Hephaestion he gave Drypetis, she was also a daughter of Darius. \u2018This meant that\n\u2018Alexander's wife sister. He wanted Hephaestion's children to be his own nephews and nieces. To\nSeleucus he gave Apama, the daughter of Spitamenes the Bactrian, and likewise to the other\n\u2018Companions the daughters of the most notable Medes and Persians, eighty inal\n\n\u2018The weddings were solemnized in the Persian fashion: chairs were placed for\nthe bridegroom in order of precedence. After the toasts, the brides entered and each sat down by\nher groom, who took them by the hand and kissed them. The king was the first to be matried, for\nall the weddings were celebrated inthe same manner, and inthis ceremony. he showed even more\nthan his customary approachability and comradeship. Then the bridegroom took their wives back\nto their homes and Alexander gave each of them a dowry. All the other Macedonians who had\npreviously married Persian women, he ordered to be registered. These were found to number more\n\u2018than 10,000, Alexander then gave them all wedding-presents.\n\nBy marrying the daughters of Darius and Artaxerxes, Alexander was both identifying himself\nWith the Persians and also making his own position more secure. He could now claim to be the son\nand rightful heir of both previous Persian kings. He also wanted to honor Hephaestion by making\nbi his brother-in-law\n\n\u2018What the Macedonians thought of these marriages is evident from the fact that all the nobles\ndivorced their wives after Alexander\u2019 death, except Hephaestion, who died before Alexander, and\nSeleucus. So, in spite of Alexander's precedent, the Macedonians were no more inclined to share\nequally withthe Persians than before.\n\nSoon after, Alexander's lifelong friend and second-in-command, Hephaestion, died in\nEcbatana from a fever, though some reports suggest he may have been poisoned. Historian\n\u2018accounts of Alexanders esponse to this event universally agree that his grief was insupportable.\nPlutarch claims that Alexander slaughtered the Cossaeans of \u00ab neighboring town as a sacrifice to\nhis frend, and Arrian writes that he had Hephaestion's doctor executed for failing o eure him. The\nmanes and tails ofthe horses were cu asa sign of mourning. Alexander refused to promote another\n"
