He\nwas prepared for this awesome responsibility partly because Aristotle, himself a Macedonian and\nstudent of Plato, was secured as teacher to tutor prince Alexander: the fourteen-year-old prince\nprobably owed his desire to pursue the unknown geographic areas of his time to Aristotle\n(Bosworth 1988, 21,\n\nIn youth, Alexander learned passion fiom his mother, Olympias, a \u201cdevotee of the\n\u2018orgiastic cults of Dionysus\u201d (Hamilton 1974, p 29). His father, Philip II, \u201chas sometimes been\ncontrasted with Olympias as supplying the Apolline or rational aspect of Alexander's characte\u201d\n(GHansilton 30) The prince's reading consisted of Euripides, who fled to the court of Atchelaus I\n\u2018of Macedon in 406 B.C. and whose plays he knew by heart (Bosworth 26) Also standard reading\nwas Homer, from which Alexander styled himself after Achilles, and his best trend,\nHephuestion, as Patrclus (Lipsius 1974, 41). Alexander would become familiar with the\nhistorian Philistus and the dithyrambie poets Telestus and Philoxenus (Bosworth 20).\n\nAlexander saw himself as destined to topple the mighty Persian empire, which had, under\n\u2018Xerxes I, antagonized Greece 150 years before (Benoist-Mechin, 1966, 28). It was conventional\nGreek thought to seek revenge: proof of this isthe traditional maxim lex talionis ~ law of\n\u2018etalation (Benoist-Mechin 40) in Aeschylus's Orestia. Greece remembered the invasion in 480\nBC. by Xerzea (ibid 22% thle led to demande of retritetion.\n"
