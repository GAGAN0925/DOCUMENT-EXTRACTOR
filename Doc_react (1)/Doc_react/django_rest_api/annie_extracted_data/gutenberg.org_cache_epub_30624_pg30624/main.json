There were aso some\npoens, still sore romantic than the histories, \u2018though generally on the\nSane thenes. The greatest productions of this kind were the writings\nOf Honer, an ancient poet uho lived and wrote four or five hundred\nYears before Alexander's day. The young Alexander was greatly\nGelighted with Homer's tales.

Aristotle had 2\nbeautiful copy of Honer's poens prepared expressly for Alexander,\nfaking great pains to have st transcribed with perfect correctness,\nand in the most elegant aanner.

AS he had no fanily, there was, of course, no direct heir\nfo the crown, and, In case of ay misfortune happening by which his,\nLife should be lost, Macedon would becone at once the prey of\n\u2018contending factions, which would immediately arise, each presenting\nSte oun candidate for the vacant throne, The sagacity and\u2019 foresight\nwich these statesmen evinced in these suggestions were. abundantly\nConfirmed in the end. Alexander did die in Asia, his vast kingdom at\nfonce fell into pieces, and it was desolated with internal conotions\nand civil wars for a Long period after his death.\n\nParmenio and antipater accordingly advised the king to postpone his,\nexpedition. They advised hin to seek wife anong the princesses oF\nGreece, and then to settle down quietly to the duties of donestic\nife, and to the government of hiz kingdom for 3 few years; then,\nvinen every thing should have becone settled and consolidated in\nGreece, and his fanily was established in the hearts of his\ncountrymen, he could leave Hacedon more safely. Public affairs would\ni on More\u2019 steadily while he lived, and, in case of his death, the\nCrown would descend, with comparatively Little danger of civil\ncomotion, to his hein.\n\nfut Alexander was fully decided against any such policy as this. He\nresolved to enbark in the great expedition at once. He concluded to\nwake Antipater his vicegerent in Macedon during his absence, and to\n\u2018ake Parwenio with hin into Asia.

Fron the northeastenn slopes of this\nwountain there descended 2 strean which Flowed north into the sea,\n\u2018thus henming Alexander's aray in.

He knew, too, that if this were done it would create a strong\nSensation throughout the whole country, iapressing every one with 3\nsense of the energy and power of the amy which he was conducting, and\nwould thus tend to intimidate the eneny, and facilitate all future\nOperations. Sut this was not all; he hed a more powerful aotive still\nfor wishing to march right on, across the river, and force his way\n\u2018through the vast bodies of cavalry on the opposite shore, and this was\n\u2018the pleasure of performing the exploit.\n\nAccondingly, as the aray advanced to the banks, they manewered to\nform in order of battle, and prepared to continue their march 25 if\n\u2018there were no obstacle to oppose then. The general order of battle of\ntthe Macedonian army was this. There was 2 certain body of troops,\narsed and organized ina peculiar manner, called the Phalanx. This\nbody was placed in the canter. The sen conposing it were very heavily\narsed. They had shields upon the left arn, and they carried spears\nSiteen feet long, and pointed with iron,\u2019 which they held firey in\ntheir two hands, uith the points projecting far before then. The men\nwere arranged in Lines, one behind the other, and all facing the\nfneny-sixteen lines, and a thousand in each\u2019 Line, or, a5 it is,\nexpressed in military phrase, a thousand in rank and sixteen in File,\nSo that the phalanx contained Sixteen thousand men.\n\nThe spears were so long that when the men stood in close onder, the\nrear ranks being brought up near to those before then, the points of\n\u2018the spears of eight on ten of the ranks projected in front, forsing @\nbristling wall of points of steel, each one of which was held in its\nlace by the strong ares of an atilletic and well-trained soldier. This\nNall no\u2019 force which could in those days be brought against it could\npenetrate. Men, horses, elephants, every thing that attenpted to rush\nlipan it, rushed only \u00a30 their own destruction. Every spear, feeling\nthe impulse of the vigorous aras which held 4, seemed to be alive,\nfand darted into its enemy, when an eneay was a\u00a2 hand, as af St felt\nHtself the flerce hostility which directed it. If the eneay remained\n{at a distance, and threw javelins or darts at the phalanx, they fell\nharmless, stopped by the shields which the soldiers wore upon the Left\nfm, and\u2019 which were held in such 3 manner ae to form 2 systen of\nScales, which covered and protected the whole mass, and made the men\nalmost invulnerable. The phalanx was thus, when only defending steel\nand in a state of rest, an army anda fortification all in one, and it\nNas almost inpregnable, gut when it took an aggressive form, pit\n[teelf in sotion, and advanced to an attack, if was infinitely sore\nFormidable. It becane then a terrible monster, covered with scales of\nbrass, from beneath which there projected forward ten thousand 2iving,\ndarting points of iron. It advanced deliverstely and calmly, but with\n3 prodigious sonentun and farce. There was nothing human in'sts\nappearance at all. It vas a huge aninal, ferocious, dogged, stubborn,\nnsensibie to pain, knowing no fear, and bearing down with resistiess\nand merciless destruction upon every thing that cane in its way. The\nphalanx was the center and soul of Alexander's aay. Powerful. and\nAnpregrable as it was, however, in ancient days, it would be helpless\nand defenseless on a modern pattle-field, Solid balls of iron, flying\nThrough the air with velocity which #akes then invisible, would tear\nhein way through the pikes and the shields, and the Godies oF the men\nwo bore them, without even feeling the obstruction.\n\n\u2018ihe phalanx was subdivided into brigades, regiments, and battalions,\n"

Its\nbeautiful windings through verdant and fertile valleys were <0\nPenouned, that every stream which initates its example is said to\n\u201cheander\u2019 tothe present day\n\nDuring all this time Paraenio had remained in the western part of Asia\nMinor with a considerable body of the army. As the spring approached,\nAlexander sent him orders to go to Gordiut, whither he was himself\nproceeding, and meet him there. He also directed that the detachnent\nNich had gone hone should, on recrossing the Hellespont, on their\nreturn, proceed eastward to Gordiun, thus making that city the general\nPendenvous for the conmencesent of his next campaign\n\none reason why Alexander desired to go to Gordium was that he wished\nto untie the famous Gordian knot. The story of the Gordian knot was\nthis, Gordius wae 2 sort of mountain farmer. One day he was plowing,\nland an eagle cane doun and alighted upon his yoke, and remained there\nUntil he Rad Finished his plowing. This was an omen, but what was the\nSignification of if? Gordius did not know, and he accordingly went \u00a30\na neighboring town in ender to consult the prophets and soothsayers:\nOn'his way he met 2 dansel, who, like Rebecca in the days of Abraham,\nwas going forth to draw water. ordius fell into conversation with\nher, and related to her the occurrence which had interested him so\nStrongly. The maiden advised him to go back and offer a sacrifice to\nSupiter, Finally, she consented to go back with him and aid him. The\naffair ended in her becoming his wife, and they Lived together in\npeace for many years upon their fara.\n\n\u2018Tey had a son named Midas. The father and mother were accustoned to\ngo cut sonetines in their cart or uagon, drawn by the oxen, Midas\ndriving. One day they were going into the ton in this way, at a tine\nwen {\u20ac happened that there waz.an aesenbly convened, which was in 3\nState of great perplexity on account of the civil dissensions and\nContests hich prevailed in the country. They had Just inquired of an\noracle what they should do, The oracle seid that \"a cart would bring\nthen 9 King, who would terminate their eternal broils.\u201d Just then\nNidas'cane up, driving the cart in which his father and mother were\nSeated. The atsenbly thought st once that this must be the cart meant\nby the oracle, and they sade Gordius king by acclamation, They took\n\u2018the cart and the yoke to preserve as sacred relics, consecrating then\nto Jupiter; and Gordius tied the yoke to the pole of the cart by 2\n\u2018thong\u2019 of Leather, making a knot so close and complicated that nobody\ncould untie it again. It was called the Gordian knot. The oracle\nSftervard said that whoever should untie this knot. should become\nfonarch of all Asia. Thus far, nobody had succeeded.\n\nAlexander felt a grest desire to see this knot and try what he coul\u00e9\nfo. He went, accordingly, into the tenple where the sacred cart had\nbeen deposited, and, after looking at the knot, and satisfying hinself\n\u2018that the task of untying 1t was hopeless, he cut it to pieces with his\nsword, How far the clrcusstances of this whole story are true, and how\nfar Fictitious, no one can tell; the story itself, however, as thus\nrelated, has cone doun from generation to generation, in every country\n\u2018f Europe, for two thousand years, and any extrication of one's self\nFron 2 difficulty by violent means has been called cutting the Gordian\n"

He went on successfully for sone weeks, moving in 2\nSoutheasterly direction, and bringing the whole country under his\ndominion, until, at length, when he reached Tarsus, an event occurred\nMich nearly tefainated his career. There were sone circumstances\neich caused him to press forward uith the utnost effort in\nSpproaching Tarsus, and, a\u00a9 the day was warm, he got very mich\nfovercone with heat\u2019 and fatigue. In this state, he went and plunged\nSuddenly into the River Cygnus to bathe\n\nNow the Cydnus is 2 snali stream, Flowing by Tarsus, and it cones down\nfrom Mount Taurus at a short distance back from the\u2019 city. Such streaas\nfare always very cold. Alexander was imediately seized with a very\nWolent chill, and was taken out of the water shivering excessively,\nland, at length, fainted away. They thought he was dying. They bore hin\nto his tent, and, 25 tidings of their leader's danger spread through\n\u2018the camp, the whole arty, officers and soldiers, were thrown into the\ngreatest constemnation and grief.\n\n\u2018A violent and protracted fever cane on. In the course of St, an\nincident occurred which strikingly \u2018llustrates the boldness\u2019 and\noriginality of Alexander's character. The nase of his physician was\nPnilip. Philip had been preparing particular medicine for hin,\nMich, it seons, required sone days to make ready. JUSE before it was\npresented, Alexander received a letter from Parnenio, informing him\nhat he had good reason to believe that Philip had been Oribed by the\nPersians to murder hin, during his sickness, by adeinistering poison\nAin the nane of medicine. He wrote, he said, to put him on his guard\n\u2018against any medicine which Philip might offer him\n\nAlexander put the letter under his pillow, and communicated its\ncontents to no one, At length, when\u2019 the medicine was ready, Philip\nbrought it in. Alexander took\u2019 the cup containing it with one hand, and\nwith the other he handed Philip the communication which he had\nreceived from Parmenio, saying, \"Read that letter.\u201d As soon as Philip\nhad finished reading it, and was ready to look up, Alexander drank off\n\u2018the draught in full, and Laid down the cup with an air of perfect\nconfidence that he had nothing 0 fear.\n\nSone persons think that Alexander watched the countenance of his\nphysician while he was reading the letter, and that he was led to take\n{the medicine by his confidence in his power to detensine the guilt or\ntthe Innocence of a person this accused by his Looks. Others suppose\nthat the act was an expression of his amplicit faith in the ntegrity\nand fidelity of his servant, and that he intended it as testinony,\nBiven in a very pointed and\u2019 decisive, and, at the sane tine, delicate\namen, that he was not suspicious of his\u2019 friends, or easily led to\nGistruse their faithfulness. Philip was, at any rate, extremely\ngratified at the procedure, and Alexander recovered.\n\nAlexander had now traversed the whole extent of Asia Minor, and had\nSubdued the entire country to his say. He was now advancing to\nanother district, that of Sycia and Palestine, which Lies on the\nastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. To enter this new territory,\nhe had to pass over a narrow plain which lay between the mountains and\nthe sea, ata place called Zstus. Here he was set by the aain body of\n\u2018the Persian army, and the great battle of Issus was fought. This,\nbattle will be the subject of the next chapter.\n"

Nothing cauld exceed the pomp and\nmagnificence of his preparations. There were inense numbers of\n\u2018Eroops, and they were of all nations, There were even a great many\nGreeks anong his forces, many of them enlisted From the Grecks oF Asia\nMinor.

He Was\nBiving a great banquet to his friends, the officers of the army, and\nto Persians of distinction anong those who had subaitted to him. There\nwas, among other women at this banquet, a very beautiful and\nAccomplished fenale naned Thais. Alexander made her his favorite and\nCompanion, though she was not his wife. Thats did all in her power \u00a30\ncaptivate and please Alexander during the feast by her vivacity, her\nit, her adroit attentions to hin, and the display of her charms, and\nat length, when he hinself, as welll as the other guests, were excited\n\u2018th wine, she acked him to allow her to have the pleasure of going\nherself and setting fire, with her own hands, to the great palace of\n\u2018the Persian kings in the\u2019 city.

The plan of Thais was carried fully into effect,\nevery half-intoxicated guest assisting, by putting fire to the immense\npile wherever they could get access to it.
