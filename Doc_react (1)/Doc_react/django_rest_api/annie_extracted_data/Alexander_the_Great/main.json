Such an explanation is convenient, but is\nit correct?\n\nFor the last two centuries, behavioral scientists have studied\nthat question through focused research on great performers of\nall types: business managers, chess players, swimmers,\nsurgeons, jet pilots, violinists, salespeople, writers, and many\nothers. Their findings, numbering in the hundreds, have led to\nconclusions that fly straight in the teeth of what \u201ceverybody\nknows\u201d about abilty\n\n\u2018The studies conclusively disproved the notion that great\nperformance stems primarily from a natural \u201cgift\u201d or talent.

Many such top performers overcame\ntheir average\u2014or even below-average\u2014intellects and\nnonexistent aptitudes to develop outstanding abilities in\ndisciplines such as chess, music, business, and medicine.\n\nExamples of such remarkable transformations abound\nthroughout history.

Michael Jordan didn't make his\nsophomore team because he was deemed too short and\naverage to play at that level.

Williams.\nlater said that such stories were all \u2018a lot of bull.\u201d He had a much\nbetter explanation for his superior skills.\n\nWilliams began his path to greatness at the age of seven,\nwhen he decided to dedicate his entire life to one singular task:\nhitting a baseball as perfectly as possible. Starting at that young\nage, Williams spent every free minute he had at San Diego's old\nNorth Park field hitting balls, every day, year after year after\nyear. His childhood friends recall finding him on that field\n\u2018smashing balls with the outer shells completely beaten off, with\n\u2018a splintered bat, and with blistered, bleeding hands. He would\nspend his lunch money to hire other kids to shag his balls so he\n\u2018could hit as many as possible every day. When the city turned\nOff the field's lights, he would go home and swing a rolled-up\nnewspaper in the mirror until he went to bed,\n\nThis obsession continued throughout William's entire\nprofessional career, and i's no surprise that he excelled\nbecause of it. For \u201cThe Kid,\u201d as he was known, greatness was a\nlong, grueling process\u2014not a gift from the beyond (a claim that\nhe found insulting).\n\nStudies of people with extraordinary abilities, ike Ted\nWillams, have given rise to what Swedish psychologist Dr. K\n\u2018Anders Ericsson called the \u201c10,000 hour\u2019 rule. The rule's,\npremise is that, regardless of whether one has an innate\naptitude for an activity or not, mastery of it takes around ten\nthousand hours of focused, intentional practice.

Once he locked his sights on the next milestone is his\njoumey, whether it be the next city to subdue or next region to\nassimilate, he spent every waking minute in action, making it so,\nIn his own words, the most slavish thing was to \u201cluxuriate,\u201d\nwhereas the most royal thing was to \u201clabor.\u201d\n\nHe also understood the power of momentum, Once you're in\nmotion, its much easier to stay 80, which allows for greater and\n\u2018greater acceleration. And the closer Alexander approached the\naccomplishment of a goal, the harder he pushed. Look at his\nactions after his briliant, but harrowing, breakthrough at the\nPersian Gates. He hadn't slept in over a day and just completed\n\u2018another perilous assault, and his officers suggested that he join\nhis men in celebration of what was sure to be the ast ofthe\nPersian defenses. After a well-deserved rest, Persepolis would\nbe theirs. Instead, Alexander did what ust came natural to him.\n\u2018A man of such impetuous drive couldn't stop when the finish line\nwas just over the horizon,\n\nIf doing the work isthe key to victory in our journeys to\n\u2018greatness, what has the power to stop us? The answer takes us\ninward, and if we are to advance in our quests, it must be\n\u2018conquered with the same vigor and determination of Alexander.\n\nThe Invisible. Insidious, and Impersonal Enemy That Hates the\nWork\n\nResistance is invisible, insidious, and impersonal. It can't be\n\u2018seen, but it's in you right now, and it can be felt. Resistance tells\nyou anything to keep you from doing the work. It wil ie, argue,\nluster, seduce, and bully you to get its way. It will say anything\nto strike a deal and then stab you in the back. It doesn't care\n"
