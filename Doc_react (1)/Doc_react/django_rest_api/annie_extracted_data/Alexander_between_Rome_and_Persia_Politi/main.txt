By the end of the fis century ace, the lands that Alexander the Great had
conquered had fallen under the sway of two vast empires In the West, Rome
dominated the Mediterranean basin and large swathes of northern Europe;
In the East, the Arsacd dynasty of Parthia reigned over the Iranian plateau,
“Mesopotamia, and pars of central Asia Though the Arsteds would ater fll
to the Sasanian dynasty and the Romans would lve their empire in the west,
the baste division ofthe anclent world between a Roman Mediterranean andan
Inanian Near East proved remarkably long-lived. Not until the Arab conquests
ofthe seventh century cx would this geopolitical status quo shatter and give
way toa new worl.

‘The Limits of Analogy

Political Ideology demands 4 coherent vision of how the world ks supposed
to look; grey areas and subtlety can dilute the force of cleat naraivs. In
the poltico-tligious worldview that emerged in Iran under the Parclans and
Sasunians, Alexander was an accursed foreign interloper whose lvasion upset
the cosmle order; in the conques-centred realm of Roma peril kdealogy,
the was a leader who had blazed an eastern trail for future generations of
rlitary commanders. Rome took his place, while Parthia and the Sasanian
‘ingdom took the place of is Persian enemles.

But the analogy only went so fr n both Rome and ran, che legacy of
Alexander was too mulifieted and too diverse to ft into any one historical
rnarative. In the Iterature of the late Republic and ealy Principat, some
‘oman observers were distinctly ertcal af the king’ legacy and, by extension,
ofthe project of eastern imperial that t underpinned, Andin the teratute

Ihstorians of Rome expressed concern thatthe king had flit with eastern
despotism in his efforts to accommodate his Persian subjects, the Persians
themselves embraced a story that made him ane of them. These traditions
‘coexisted with the Alexander analogy thatthe dynamics of Roman-Parthian
sind Roman-Sasanlan relations had foregrounded sometimes uneasily, and
ometimes even within the confines ofa single text.
InRome, Alexander’ example could sometimes be deployed to highlightthe
‘aeacherous pitfall of eastern imperialism rather than the glory that successful
‘conquerors could eam. After the death of Publius Crassus (son ofthe tui
“Mareus Crassus) in battle against the Parthians at Cathae in s3ucx,Cleero
lamented thatthe young man had been kiled “wale he was trying to be

and Macedonlan conquerors is conttasted with the austere honour and sober
‘wisdom of Crassus ancestors and hs sevice In the Carthae campaign ls sald
to have resulted from “a ite of ambition unsuited to young men Moreover,
Alexander is pated with Cyrus the Great, the founder ofthe Achaementd
Ene and, in this passage, Alexanders moral equivalent. For Cicero, che
“Macedonian provided no better an example than the Persian.
Such wariness of Alexander’ mileary adventuism was shared by Lucas
Annaeus Seneca, who wrote under the later Juio-Claudlan emperors. In @
lester this comrespondent Lucius dealing the nature of Stole virtue, Seneca

Conclusion

As te empires of Iran and Rome settled Into along and complex period of

Imperial contestation and coexistence, the memory of Alexander the Great

supplied an anclent precedent for contemporary politcal developments. In

some respects, the Macedonians invasion ofthe Achaemenid Emplie set the
stage for the Roman-Prsian relationship, which took the form of an east
west rivalry between the imitators of Alexander and the descendants of his

‘opponent Dard. For Romsan commanders and the authors who recorded ther

cexplots, Alexanders example provided a reference point with which Roman

accomplishments inthe East could be measured, compared, and contasted
forthe Sasanins (and pethaps the Arscids too, though the evidence fr thelr
peti far more tenuous), the eampaigns against Rome in the west might be

Jusfied asa fight to avenge the Kayanian dynasty that the “Roman” Alexander

had destroyed

‘To be sure, Alexander’ legacy operated differently in Iranian and Roman,
traditions, because the two sides had diferent conceptions of history. The

Partlans and Sasanians sem to have assigned Alexander the Roman identity

of thelr contemporary rivals, mapping the clrumstances of the present back

‘nto the past The Romans, onthe ether hand, alld ther easter foes Medes,

Possans, and Achaemenids—boreowing tenn from older Greek terature on

the Achaemenid to describe thelr enemies in the present. In ths sense, lan

ans used the present desenbe the past, andthe Romans the past to desertbe
the present. In both cases, though, the International arena was interpreted by

‘means of an historical analogy: the Romans took Alexanders place, and the

Parthlans and Sasanians assumed the mantle of his enemies,
