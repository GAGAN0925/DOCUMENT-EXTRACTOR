Despite its challenges, this campaign would\nhave a lasting impact in Central Asia. Infact, it still resonates inthe historical memory of\nUzbekistan today. To fully appreciate the importance of these events, we must first place\n\u2018Sogdiana geographically. The region of Sogdiana encompassed most of what today is known as\nmodem Uzbekistan and part of Tajikstan. In ancient times Sogdiana bordered the region known,\nas Bactria tothe south, which included much of modern Afghanistan, and border areas of\nUsbekistan and Tajikistan, Only an army exceptionally well-led and possessing a highly\ndeveloped logistical capability could have waged an effective campaign in such a remote and\nforbidding location.\n\n\u2018When we examine Alexander the Great\u2019s campaign in Sogdiana in its historical context,\nthis is what is known, The reason for Alexander's military campaign in Sogdiana was that he\nWanted to cement his position asthe ruler of Asia.

Military historian David J. Lonsdale's book Alexander the Great\nLessons in strategy focuses on Alexander the Greats military career, but analyzes in depth the\n\u2018campaign in Sogdiana, Lonsdale describes Alexander's campaign in Sogdiana as\ncounterinsurgency, aterm widely employed in modern military studies to describe efforts to\ndefeat guerilla resistance. Lonsdale asserts that Alexander had a clea politcal objective to\n\u2018reat a stale and unified country. Therefore, his concept for governance dealt with social,\neconomic, security, and administrative problems, as well as a strategic phan to secure his base\nareas. Lonsdale also spends much time analyzing Alexander's sueeess in Sogdiana, and takes\n\u2018postion opposing the thesis of Holt and others who would diminish Alexanders significance.\nLonsdale contends, \u201cAlexander had to complement his military conquests with astute pre-and\npost-conflict policies to cement his rule. This isnot to detract from the significance of\n\u2018Alexander's military achievements, upon which the conquests were based. Indeed, the non-\nmilitary elements of Alexander's grand strategy would have been extremely vulnerable without\nte security and authority delivered by force.\" Lonsdale\u2019s argument makes us wonder whether\nHot misunderstands the military strategy of Alexander the Great. Miltary strategy never\n\u2018operates in vacuum, Why does the act of making concessions with the Sogdian, as Holt\nclaims, undermine the assertion that Alexander the Great conquered Sogdiana?\n"

Inthe first are those with the view that Alexander's\n\u2018campaign was unnecessary and ineffective. Take Holt, for example, who argues that Alexander's\ncolonial successors were the ones who really changed Sogdiana.\u201d* Holt also argues Alexander\nnever fully conquered Sogdiana, because revolts continued after he left\u201d Smith takes a very\nsimilar view as Holt. In the opposing eamp, the prevailing view is that Alexander was forthe\nmost part suecessful based on a flexible and imaginative approach. Moreover, as we have seen,\nAntela-Bemnandez cautions against reading the present into the past. And then there is Lonsdale,\nwho brings @ unique military background to his analysis and takes a position in favor of\n\u2018Alexander, supporting the idea ofa successful campaign, without addressing the question of\nlasting impact.\n\nIn conclusion, itis evident that the competing models analyzing Alexander's Sogdian\n\u2018campaign efleet the need for a reassessment of this campaign. To be persuasive this\nreassessment must include a multidimensional analysis ofthe evidence based on all aspects of\nthe campaign\n\nHL, Primary Sources\n\n\u2018When we examine the very incomplete primary source evidence for Alexander the Great,\nitis often tricky to decipher what explanation of events is most likely to be true.

For Alexander the Great to use this \u201croyal\u201d city as a rallying point appears to signify\nhis authority in Sogdiana, as well as to affirm his strategic dominance\n\n\u2018There is evidence to suppor this argument based on how much Alexander the Great\ncared about Marakanda, When Spitamenes laid siege to Marakanda and defeated the fest\nMacedonian attempt to relieve the siege, Alexander took matters into his own hands. This is\nhhow Arian describes Alexander's reaction: \u201cNews ofthe debacle caused Alexander great\ndistress, and he determined to march with all speed against Spitamenes and the tribesmen with\nhhim....In three days he covered about 185 mils, and at dawn on the fourth was close to the\ntown\" Therefore, i is evident that Marakanda was very important to Alexander the Great and\ncrucial this authority inthe region. This case illustrates Alexander's keen sense of polities and\n\u2018the symbolism of imperial authority.\n\n\u2018After the rebellion, Alexander the Great made a shrewd political move by marrying the\ndaughter of \u201cOxyartes, who was a Sogdian rebel leader. The daughter was named \u201cRexane.\"*\n\u2018This marriage toa high status woman helped solidify Alexander's claim as ruler ofthe region,\n\u2018because now he was officially connected to the local people. The potential foundation of a\n\u2018new dynasty could base its claim to legitimacy on the basis of native as well as Greek\nheritage. Marriage alliances were not uncommon to Alexander; earlier on his campaigns in the\nPersian Empire he had Macedonian soldiers mary Persian women.\u00ae\u201d\n"

This included various fortified or fortifiable\nstructures, as well as new towns. For example, as Ihave mentioned before, Marakanda\n(Samarkand) had a military garrison and served asa rallying point for Alexander the Great's\narmy, meaning it was one of his main bases in Sogdiana.

Ifyou were to google \u201cNur Fortress\u201d every tourist site talks\nabout it but there is not one scholarly source I could locate about the fortress. was able to visit.\nthe Nur Fortress and the locals told me all about how Alexander the Great was there, Accounts\nlinked Alexander closely to some of the most notable features ofthe city, such asa famous\nspring. What I saw atthe site were massive walls encompassing a large swath of land, located\nata strategic point atop ofa large hill, overlooking the modern day city of Nurata. Further,\n\u2018Nurata was positioned so as to be the foremost defensive point of Sogdiana looking to the\n\u2018northwest. Nurata was the last outpost before reaching the desert and was in a exitcal position,\n\u2018because this site is north of and between Bukhara and Marakanda two very important etis in\nSogdiana. Therefore, if Nurata fll it would leave both these valuable cities exposed. As a\n\u2018result, it makes great strategic sense for tis to be a location Alexander would have used, i not\n"

OF course when I did academie research on te site, I Found no new information\ncortoborating any ofthese claims. This isnot to say it is all made up and untrue: there is just no\nscholarly evidence at this point in ime, Archaeological excavation in Nurata has been minimal\ntodate\n\n\u2018They then went on to tell me that there is tiny neighboring village called \u201cMacedonia\u201d\nin honor of Alexander the Great. ln fact, inthe village, they even have a memorial for him and\nhis wife Roxane in the form of an honorific gravesite, There is also a local restaurant bearing the\ntown\u2019s orginal name given by Alexander called \u201cNur Restaurant.\u201d Another restaurant connected\nto Alexander is in the Uzbek capital Tashkent, which is named \u201cIskander Shashlik\u201d in honor of\n\u2018Alexander. personally have been toa different restaurant in Tashkent that even bad a meal\nnamed after Alexander called \u201cThe Alexander.\" Thinking about all of this it dawned on me that\n"

Conclusion\n\nIn the end, an assessment of the evidence leads one to conclude that when Alexander the\nGreat led his army to Sogdiana, he not ony successfully conquered the region, but he\nsuccessfully planted Hellenistic influence, in turn ensbrining his legacy in the region. What\n\u00abenabled Alexander the Great to be so successful was a ruthlessly efficient military strategy,\nsupported by a blend of sheer eruelty and unexpected accommodation, as well asa rare degre of\nsituational and cultural awareness to navigate unforeseen obstacles, andthe construction of\nfortifications throughout Sogdiana, These factors allowed Alexander to become the unquestioned\nruler of Sogdiana, Now, scholars Frank L. Holt and Michele Smith would object to this view,\nbased on a different interpretation of events and evidence. However, in my view. it is better not\nto understand this campaign from a contemporary twentieth or even twenty-first century\nmindset. In order to do this campaign justice we must examine it based on the era in which i\n\u2018occurred and in light of Alexander's own goal.
