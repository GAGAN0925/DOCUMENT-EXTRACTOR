However, as Faustina Doufikar-Acrs has pointed out in het\nalso-ecent and monumental Alevander Magnus Arabicus, Alexander was\n\u2018not an obviously philosophical figure for Arabs'\u2014even less so, | would say,\nthan for Greeks and Romans who were the direct inheritors of his conquests,\nThis paper therefore seeks to examine what Greco-Roman views of Alexan-\ndr and philosophy have in common with those found in easter traditions\nThe association between Alexander and philosophy seems to operate on {0\nlevels in each tradition. One level is \u201chistorical, seen in references to Alex-\nander's historical tutleage by Aristotle (and interestingly, to his nephew Cal~\nlisthenes in the Greco-Roman sources) as well as in his encounters with the\n(Cynic Diogenes and the so-called Brabmans in India, The other level is gen=\ncrazing or symbolic, where the idea of philosophy\u2019 or encoun-\ntersladvisement by groups of philosophers, often lumped together anachro-\nnistically, positions Alexander in such a\u2019 way as to give him cache by\ncomparison, orto critique him by contrast. The context, however, does not\nalways \u2018match\u2019 the philosopher: encounters between Alexander and Aristo\ntle, for example, are not necessarily used to make an Aristotelian point. This\ndoes not mean, however, that there is no a \u201creal\u201d philosophy\u2019 behind a par-\nticular writer's generalizations about Alexander and philosophy. It means\nthat most writers priority was aot to \u201cda justice\u2019 to ether Alexander of to &\nspecific philosophical school or philosopher, but to promote a particular idea\n\u2018of philosophy that happened to be relevant to world-conquest\u2014something\ncevidently on the minds of Greeks, Romans, Persians and Arabs alike\n"

The emphasis\nof all is monarchy, both human and divine: Alexander's character ranges\nfiom king of kings in the Pscudo-Calisthenes tradition to the philosopher-\nking (and eventually missionary) in the Wisdom literature tradition to the\n\u2018pious monotheist and missionary king\" inthe Dhu' I-Qamayn tradition t0\nthe \u2018explorer, who, inspite of himself, fulfils the role of missionary king on\nGods command\u201d inthe Sira tradition *\n\nThe motif of philosophy\u2019 is particularly frequent in the Wisdom Tradi-\ntion, for example, in set-piece likes the \u201cFuneral Sentences\", where philoso-\npphers make pronouncements, one after the other at Alexander's deathbed. It\nts in the Wisdom tradition that Aristotle finally gets his duc: indeed,\nDouikar-Aerts has postulated that the ewly-discovered Epistolary Ro-\n\u2018mance, a series of philosophical letters between Alexander and Aristotle that\nsocms to have developed independently from the Pseudo-Callsthenestradi-\ntion, are a major source for Alexander Wisdom literature. What is striking\nfor the purpose of my argument is that, even at a time when Arab thinkers\nwere deeply engaged with Aristotle, his presence in the Alexander-indition\nseems rather fully fictionalized, a function not of Aristotelian philosophy\u201d\n\n(Canova (ed) Oneme Modena, Ses on Araie Epc, 222,83 a3, (203) $0820,\n\neb 507)\nM0 Gensch (Un rm dpsoice eecoarte\u2019 in 1.
