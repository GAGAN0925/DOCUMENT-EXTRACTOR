Neither \u00e9hos nor dann are easily\ntranslated, and antirop is often ignored. But the maxim is senseless if any part of\nit depends on powers outside of the individual. It isthe truth ofthis maxim\u2014\nhich presupposes effective human agency\u2014that makes the creation of historical\nnarrative rather than divine myth or heroic epic, even possible.* Hesiod, Homer,\nand to a certain extent Plutarch many centuries later, want to argue that itis\nprimarily ancestry or pedigree that will determine destiny. Undeniably in the\nfifth century the well-born will often have greater autonomy, authority, and\nagency.\n\nCClaims that Herodotus reveals himself as a proto-biographer are not yet\nwidely accepted. In an article lamenting the gap between Herodotus and\nXenophon \u2014Helene Homeyer makes the claim that Herodotus is also the father of\nbiography.* To advance this claim, I have selected one exceptional individual,\nprince Alexander, later king Alexander I of Macedon. An individual, who\npatticipated in the Helleno-Persian Wars, but one not found among those\nnotables recognised by Plutarch in his Parallel Lies. By hopscotching through five\n\u2018of the nine books of Herodotus\u2019 Historic, even ifthe entries fall short of a cradle\nto grave depiction, we can assemble a reasonably continuous narrative for\nAlexander, and thus through his exploits, gauge his character against the epic\nheroines and heroes described by Homer!

It is when taking his flet from the Strymonic Gulf around the\nCChaleidian Peninsula that Mardonios loses some three-hundred ships from his\nfleet and some twenty-thousand soldiers before reaching Macedon territory west\nff the peninsula (Hl. 6.44.23). With these crippling losses punitive raids on\nAthens and Eretria, let alone permanent subjugation, are no longer feasible and\nMardonios ignominiously withdraws to Asia (Hel. 645) Since Mardonios fails $0\nmiserably, next year in 491, Darius appoints two other generals, Datis and\nArtaphrenes with instructions to enslave both Athens and Eretria (Ht. 694.20),\nPartly because of the unpredictable storms in the northem Aegean and a desire to\nsubjugate a numberof city-states on islands inthe Aegean Sea the nev strategy is\n\u2018one of which can best be described of island -hopping over the Cyclades Islands\n\n\u2018Alexander will doubtless have viewed this new strategy with a mixture of\nrelief and apprehension\u2014rlief that another land army would not be crossing,\n\u2018over from the Hellespont to Thrace\u2014and apprehension that a large amphibious\nforce routed safely through the Cyclades might successfully invade Attica and\ncontinue on through tothe Peloponnese with some city-states medizing without a\nfight. As things turn out Eretria is betrayed from within and razed tothe ground,\nbbut the Athenians, with Miltiades as commanding general and without Spartan\nassistance, defeats Datis at Marathon in the summer of 490. Furthermore, the\npromised betrayal from within Athens never materialises\u2014the Persian invasion\nfleot gets as far as anchoring off Phaleron only to see the victors at Marathon\nwaiting for them.

What is\nimportant is that Alexander has eared and subsequently been awarded these\nsignificant honours on proven merit and that the Persian commanders know so.\nBut we can surmise that just as Alexander knows something of what is\nhappening in Athens and in Sparta, he will also be fully aware of what i aot in\nSusa.\u00ae\n\nFollowing the sack of Sardis in 498, Darius resolves to subjugate all of Hellas\nonce and forall (Hdt 5105.1). Later, goaded by his mother, Atoss, for yet another\ninvasion of the Greek mainland Darius dies in 484 in the midst of his preparations\n(Hat. 74), His heir, Xerxes, inerits these preparations and one of his generals,\nMardonios, is anxious to argue for revenge and perhaps covets the appointment\nas the satrap ofall Hellas himself (Hel. 7.6.2) ts in 484 that Xerxes assembles\nthe Persian nobility to discuss his plan forthe invasion of Hellas and tells them\n(Hat.78),\n\n\"intend to bridge the Hellespont and lead my\u2019 army through Europe to Hella, so\nthat we can punish the Athenians forall that they did to the Persians and to my\nfather.

And in due\ncourse, that is exactly what Xerxes does. Once the Athenians and Spartans know\nthat Xerxes has crossed the Hellespont into Thrace and is moving toward\n\u201cMacedon and Thessaly they decide to act Ht. 7.172).

Herodotus does not\nsay whether Macedonian forces commanded by Alexander\u2014probably cavalry \u2014\nwere present at the battle of Thermopylae in August or September of 480.\novvever, just prior to that battle when the Persian forces assemble near Cape\nSepias, Herodotus lists the men inthe forces recruited from Europe.\n\nLand forces were proved by the Tracans,Paloians, Fidians Botiaian, the nation\n\nof Chaldicians, Brygol, Pierians, Macedonians, Peraibians, Ainanes, Dolopians,\n\nMagpesians, Achacans, and all who inhabited the coastal region of Thrace (Hat\n\n71852),\n\nIn the aftermath of the Spartan defeat at Thermopylae, the Persians, gleefully\nguided by the Thessalians, overrun the entie country of Phocis freely burning,\npillaging, and raping their way south (LHdt, 832-833). However, the entire\npopulation of Boootia, who pragmatically medize ater the battle of Thermopylae,\nare protected by Macedonian troops from the threat of unsanctioned Persian\nravages. Herodotus writes,\n\nAfter leaving Parapotamioi the barbarians came to Panopereos, and there Xerses|\n\n\u2018orld out his army and divided it in two, The lggest and strongest part continued\n\n\u2018with Xerxes to invade Bosotia through the lerstory of Orchomenus and mach\n\ntowatd Athens The entre population of Bosoia were medizing and tei tes were\n\nbeing protected by some Macedonians who had been appointed and sent to them by\n\n[Alesandtos. The purpose behind this move was to make cleat to Xernes thatthe\n\n\u2018ocotians were taking the side ofthe Medes (Hal, $3),\n\n1.

He\nsould not have forgotten the Persian's behaviour toward women at his father\u2019s\npalace thirty years earlier and now he appears to be challenging Xerxes to insist\nthat his own troops and allied levees act honourably. The simple presence of a\nhandful of Macedonian cavalrymen in each Bocotian settlement would deter\nundisciplined marauders from preying on the defenceless civilian population no\nmatter whichever part of Xerxes\u2019 empire\u2014Asia or Europe\u2014they came from,\n\u2018Clearly the Macedonians were not involved in the illomened Persian raid on\nDelphi, a grotesque act of impiety that would appall any ruler daiming Hellenic\nvalues\n\nWhether Macedonian troops take part on the sack of Athens, Herodotus\ndoes not say, nor do we know whether Macedonian troops assemble at Phaleron,\nPerhaps they were too busy with their garrison duties in Bosotia and only rejoin\nMardonios when he withdraws to Thessaly after the naval disaster at Salamis?\nHerodotus makes no further mention of Alexander until the winter of 480/479\nwhen the Persian general Mardonios withdraws his troops from Altica and is\n\u2018encamped in Thessaly. Here, taking advantage of Alexander's status as both\nprosenos and euergetes, Mardonios seeks to break up the Hellenic Alliance with a\ndeal. We must not forget that in whatever capacity she or he may act\nambassadors\u2014are essentially very noble but obedient messengers.\n\n\u2018After Mardonis had read the oracles, he sent Alevander of Macedon, the son of\n\n\u201cAmyalas, as a messenger to Athens, because the Persians were related 19 Aleander|\n\nby martage; Gygaia, who was the daughter of Amyntas and Alexander's sister, was\n\nthe wife of Boubares of Persia. She had given birth to Amyntas of Asia, who bore\nthe name of his matemal grandfather and to who the King had given the large\n\nPheygian city of Alabanda from which to draw revenues. Moreover, since Mardonios\n\nhha heard that Alexander was aproenos and a benefactor of Athens, 2 he thought\n\nthat by this move he could best succed in winning over the Athenians to his side\n\nBecause he had learned that they were a populous and warlike people, and he knew\n\nthatthe disaster that had befallen the Persian at sea had been accomplished mainly\n\nby the Athenians, [3] he fully anticipated that of they were on his side, he would\neasily goin contol over the sea which was certainly a corect assumption (Ht\n\n8136.19,\n\nBelieving an oracle that suggests that the Persians should ally with the\nAthenians, Mardonios decides to send Alexander to Athens to present an offer\nthat purports to come from Xerxes (Hdl, \u00a7:1363).* Herodotus reports Alexander's\nspeech tothe assembled Athenians, an assembly which includes some messengers\nfrom Sparta, as follows:\n\n32.

Just naming an individual, and closely\nassociating her or him with an historical event, has the effect of granting that\nindividual agency and therefore some responsibility or credit if things go rather\n\u2018well, and some culpability ifthe desired outcome is not obtained.

                "ocr_text": "selected individual right in the front row of history. In short, Herodotus makes\nsure that story remains part of history. Although he is blissfully unaware of a\n\u2018new and important literary genre to come; this amounts to proto-biography.\n\nAlthough the focus ofthis study is on one exceptional individu, all of the\nforegoing is written with an acute awareness of the narrative issues lurking.\n\u2018behind non-fiction literary genres. Inthe proem to his Histories, Herodotus claims\nthathe is interested in the cause of the Greeks and Persians warring against each\nother (Hit. 1.1). Perhaps: but not solely In his quest for causation Herodotus\ncannot resist delighting himself and therefore his audiences by weaving into his\nhistorical narative all manner of fascinating digressions, including material that\nliterature scholars might\u2014almost two and a half millennia later\u2014want to lasify|\nas biographical sub-narratives. But Herodotus does not stop there. He might now\n\u2018be recognised as the first Westem historian, but in the mid-fith-centary this non-\nfiction iterary genre is very new. It is not that the genre boundaries are ill-\ndefined; there were none. Consequently the author of the Histories can segue in\nhis book-rolls from fanciful meteorology, to the geography of far-away places\nwith strange-sounding names, to a discussion of dowries, and then to the\nsometimes very diferent matrimonial customs adopted by other peoples.\n\n[Notions of Pan-Hellenism are evident throughout the life of Alexander I. His\nMacedon people may not yet be even faintly accepted by others as true Hellenes,\n\u2018but the Macedonian inclusion quest has to start somewhere, And it starts with\nAlexander. Of course, if he is eligible, then doubtless his ancestors were also\ncligile. Perhaps they were far too busy with other matters, Then there are\npractical issues to consider: travelling 600 to 700 kilometres, plus the expenses\nand extended absence from the kingdom. Because of geographical realities his\nautonomy and agency are constrained. Alexander cannot pursue meaningful\n\u2018membership in any formal Hellen military alliance until the existence of such an.\nalliance itself poses a formidable and credible deterrent to any potential\naggressors\n\n\u2018Nevertheless, Herodotus\u2019 interest in Pan-Hellenism is evident in his choice of\nswords, a choice that is dramatically different from the choices made by Homer\"\nWhat Herodotus\u2019 contrast shows is that the trident of three A\u2019s\u2014agency,\nautonomy, and authoritycan be used for good or ill and that possession of great\n\n47, Herodotus exprossion \u201cpie Coy yeyie te xa oyacta\u201d is wanslated in the\nproem as \u201cgreat and wonderful deeds\u201d altematives include \u201cmarvelous exploits\u2019 \u2014\nnother word signals any degree of disbelief but irespectve of whether these are deeds oF\n\u2018exploits we sil infer human agency.\n\n48.
