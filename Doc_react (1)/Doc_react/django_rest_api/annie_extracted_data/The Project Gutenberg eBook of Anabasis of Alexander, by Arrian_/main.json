                "ocr_text": "PREFACE.\n\n\\Wutex T began this Translation, more than two years ago, [had no intention of publishing it;\nDut as the Work progressed, it occurred to me that Arian is an Author deserving of more\nattention from the English-speaking races than he has yet received. No edition of his works\nhs, so far as [am aware, ever appeared in England, though on the Continent many have\n\u2018been published. In the following Translation I have tried to give as literal a rendering of the\nGreek text as I could without transgressing the idioms of our own language. My theory of\nthe duty of a Translator is, to give the ipsissima verba of his Author as nearly as possible,\n\u2018and not put into his mouth words which he never used, under the mistaken notion of\nimproving his diction or his way of stating his case. It is a comparatively easy thing to give\n2 paraphrase of a foreign work, presenting the general drift of the original; but no one,\nunless he has himself tied it, can understand the difficulty of translating a classical Author\ncorrectly without omission or mutilation,\n\nIn the Commentary which I have compiled, continual reference has been made to the\nother extant authorities on the history of Alexander, such as Diodorus, Plutarch, Curtus,\nJustin, and Aelian; so that I think I may safely assert that, aking the Translation and the\n\u2018Notes together, the book forms a complete history of Alexander's reign, Much geographical\nand other material has also been gathered from Herodotus, Strabo, Pliny, and Ammianus;\n\u2018and the allusions to the places which are also mentioned in the Old Testament are given\nfrom the Hebrew.\n\n\u2018As Arrian lived in the second century of the present era, and nearly five hundred years\nafter Demosthenes, it is not to be expected that he wrote classical Greek. There are,\nhowever, at least a dozen valuable Greek authors of this century whose works are still\nextant, and of these iti a safe statement to make, that Arran isthe best of them all, with the\nsingle exception of Lucian. 1 have noticed as many of his deviations from Attic Greek\nconstructions as I thought suitable to a work of this kind. A complete index of Proper Names\nhhas been added, and the quantities of the vowels marked for the aid of the English Reader.\nIn the multiplicity of references which I have put into the Notes, I should be sanguine if\nimagined that no errors will be found; but if such occur, I must plead as an excuse the\npressure of work which a teacher in a large school experiences, leaving him very litle\n\u2018energy for literary labour.\n\nELC.\n"

In consequence of this, he\nassumed the name of Flavius.\u201d In the same way the Jewish historian, Josephus, had been\nallowed by Vespasian and Titus to bea the imperial name Flavius.\u201d\n\nPhotius says, that Arrian had a distinguished career in Rome, being entrusted with\nvarious political offices, and at last reaching the supreme dignity of consul under Antoninus\nPius. Previous to this he was appointed (A.p. 132) by Hadrian, Governor of Cappadocia,\nWhich province was soon after invaded by the Alani, or Massagetae, whom he defeated and\nexpelled. When Mareus Aurelius came to the throne, Atrian withdrew into private life and\nreturned to his native city, Nicomedia. Here, according to Photius, he was appointed priest\nto Demeter and Persephone. He died inthe reign of Marcus Aurelius.\n\n\u2018The earlier literary efforts of Atrian were philosophical. After the expulsion of the\nphilosophers from Rome, by Domitian, Epictetus delivered his lectures at Nicopolis, in\nEpirus, where itis probabie that Arvian was his pupil\n\nI. These lectures were published by Artian, under the tile of Discourses of Epictetus, in\neight books, the frst four only of which have come down to us. He tells us himself in the\nintroduction to this work, that he strove as far as possible to preserve the very words of his\nteacher as mementoes of his method of reasoning and dition. Gellius (xix. 1) speaks of a\nfifth book ofthese Discourses.\n\nTI, He also compiled The Enchiidion of Epictetus, an abstract of the philosophy of\nEpictetus, which i till extant. This manual of the Stoic moral philosophy was very popula,\nboth among Pagans and Christians, for many centuries.\n\nIIL Another work by Arrian, in twelve books, distinct from the above, is mentioned by\nPhotius under the tile of \u201cOia Exuceixov\u201d, oF Friendly Conversations with Epictetus.\nOf this only a few fragments survive.\n\nIV. Another lost work of Arrian on the life and death of Epictetus is mentioned by\nSimplicius in the beginning of his Commentary on the Enehiridion.\n\nV. Besides editing these philosophical works, Arrian wrote many original books. By far\n\u2018the most important of these isthe Anabasis of Alexander, or the History of Alexander the\nGreat's Campaigns. This is one of the most authentic and accurate of historical works\n\u2018Though inspired with admiration for his hero, the author evinces impartiality and freedom\nfrom hero-worship. He exhibits great literary acuteness in the choice of his authorities and\nin sifting evidence. The two chief sources from which he drew his narrative were the\nhistories written by Prolemy, son of Lagus, and Aristobulus, son of Aristobulus, both of\nwhom were officers in Alexander's army. Other authorities quoted by Arrian himself were:\n\u2014Bratosthenes, Megasthenes, Nearchus, Aristus, and Asclepiades. He also made use of\n\u2018Alexander's letters, which he mentions five times:* only once, however, quoting the exact\nwords of the writer. The last authority which he mentions, is the Royal Diary kept by\nEumenes, of Cardia, the private seereiary of Philip as well as of Alexander, and by the\nhistorian Diodotus, of Erythrae. It is used by Arrian only once,\u201d as itis by Plutarch.\"\n\nVL. The work\u2019 named Indica, is a description of India, and was usually united in\nmanuscripts with the Anabasis, as an eighth book. Though it may be looked upon as a\nsupplement to the Anabasis, Arran often refers in the one work to the other.\u201d From this we\nmay infer that the author wished the Indica to be considered a distinct book from the\n\u2018Anabasis; and from the remark in Anab. v. 1, itis clear that it was composed ater the\n\u201cAnabasis, This book is wrtten in the Tonic dialect, like the History of Herodotus and the\nIndica of Ctesias. The latter untrustworthy book Arrian wished to supplant by is own\nnarrative, principally based on the works of Megasthenes and Nearchus.\n\nVIL. Photius mentions among Atran\u2019s historical works:\u2014The Events after Alexander, in\nten books, which gives the history of Alexander's successors. Photius (cod. 92) has\npreserved many extracts from this work.\n\nVIII.

He reveived\n\u2018the honour which he asked from all except the Lacedaemonians,\" who replied that it was an\nhereditary custom of theits, not to follow others but to lead them, The Athenians also\nattempted to bring about some political change; but they were so alarmed at the very\napproach of Alexander, that they conceded to him even more ample public honours than\n\u2018those which had been bestowed upon Philip He then returned into Macedonia and busied\nhimself in preparing for the expedition into Asia,\n\nHowever, at the approach of spring (nc. 335), he marched towards Thrace, into the\nlands of the Tribalians and Ilyrians,\"' because he ascertained that these nations were\nmeditating a change of policy; and at the same time, as they were lying on his frontier, he\n\u2018thought it imexpedient, when he was about to start on a campaign so far away from his own\nland, to leave them behind him without being entirely subjugated. Setting out then from!\nAmphipolis, he invaded the land of the people who were called independent Thracians,\u201d\u201d\nkeeping the city of Philippi and mount Orbelus on the left.

Here, along the defiles up the ascent to\nthe mountain, he was met by many of the traders equipped with arms, as well as by the\nindependent Thracians, who had made preparations to check the further advance of his\nexpedition by seizing the summit of the Haemus, along which was the route forthe passage\nof his army. They had collected their waggons, and placed them in front of them, not only\nusing them as a rampart from which they might defend themselves, in ease they should be\nforced back, but also intending to let them loose upon the phalanx of the Macedonians,\nWhere the mountain was most precipitous, if they tried to ascend.

Filling these with archers and\nhheavy-armed troops, he sailed to the island to which the Triballians and Thracians had fled\nfor refuge. He tried to force a landing: but the barbarians came to meet him at the brink of\nthe river, where the ships were making the assault. But these were only few in number, and\nthe army in them small. The shores of the island, also, were in most places too steep and\nprecipitous for landing, and the current ofthe river alongside it, being, as it were, shut up\ninto a narrow channel by the nearness of the banks, was rapid and exceedingly difficult to\nstem\n\u2018Alexander therefore led back his ships, and determined to eross the Ister and march\nagainst the Getae, who dwelt on the other side of that river; for he observed that many of\n\u2018them had collected on the bank ofthe river forthe purpose of barring his way, if he should\ncross. There were of them about 4,000 cavalry and mote than 10,000 infantry. At the same |\ntime a strong desire seized him to advance beyond the Ister. He therefore went on board the\nfleet himself. He also filled with hay the hides which served them as tent-coverings, and\ncollected from the country around all the boats made from single trunks of tees. Of these\nthere was a great abundance, because the people who dwell near the Ister use them for\nfishing inthe river, sometimes also for journeying to each other for traffic up the river; and\nmost of them earry on piracy with them.

Moreover, the defeat of the Lacedaemonians at Leuctra and Mantinea filled them with\nconsternation rather by the unexpectedness of the disaster than because of the number of\n\u2018those who perished.

The capture of the city of the\nPlataeans was not a great calamity, by reason of the small number of those who were taken\nin it; most of the citizens having long before escaped to Athens * Again, the capture of\nMelus and Scione simply related to insular States, and rather brought disgrace to those who\nperpetrated the outrages than produced great surprise among the Grecian community as\" a\nwhole.\n\nBut the Thebans having effected their revolt suddenly and without any previous\nconsideration, the eapture ofthe city being brought about in so short a time and without\ndifficulty on the part ofthe eaptors, the slaughter, being great, as was natural, from its being\nmade by men of the same race who were gluttng their revenge on them for ancient injuries,\nthe complete enslavement ofa city which excelled among those in Greece at that time both\nin power and warlike reputation, all this was attributed not without probability 10 the\navenging wrath ofthe deity.

They resolved to occupy the Cadmea with a garrison; to raze the city to\nthe ground; to distribute among themselves all the terttory, except what was dedicated to\nthe gods; and to sell into slavery the women and children, and as many of the males as\nsurvived, except those who were priests or priestesses, and those who were bound to Philip\n\u2018r Alexander by the ties of hospitality or had been public agents of the Macedonians.

There is indeed a\nreport that Alexander pronounced Achilles fortunate in getting Homer as the herald of his\nfame to posterity.\" And in truth it was meet that Alexander should deem Achilles fortunate\nfor this reason especially; for to Alexander himself this privilege was wanting, a thing which\nwas not in accordance with the rst of his good fortune. His achievements have, therefore,\nnot been related to mankind in a mannet worthy of the hero. Neither in prose nor in verse\nhhas any one suitably honoured him; nor has he ever been sung of in a lyric poem, in which\nstyle of poetry Hiero, Gelo, Theto, and many others not at all comparable with Alexander,\nhave been praised.\u201d Consequently Alexander's deeds are far less known than the meanest\nachievements of antiquity. For instance, the march of the ten thousand with Cyrus up to\nPersia against King Artaxerxes, the tragic fate of Clearchus and those who were captured\nalong with him,\" and the march ofthe same men down tothe sea, in which they were led\nbby Xenophon, are events much better known to men through Xenophon\u2019s narrative than are\n\u2018Alexander and his achievements. And yet Alexander neither accompanied another man\u2019s,\nexpedition, nor did he in flight from the Great King overcome those who obstructed his\nmarch down to the sea. And, indeed, there is no other single individual among Greeks oF\nbarbarians who achieved exploits so great or important either in regard to number or\nmagnitude as he did. This was the reason which induced me to undertake this history, not\nthinking myself incompetent to make Alexander's deeds known to men. For whoever I may\nbe, this T know about myself, that there is no need for me to assert my name, for it is not\nunknown 10 men; nor is it needful for me to say what my native land and family are, or if\nhhave held any public office in my own country. But this Ido asset, that this historical work\nis and has been from my youth up, in place of native land, family, and public offices to me;\nand for this reason 1 do aot deem myself unworthy to rank among the first authors in the\nGreek language, if Alexander indeed is among the first in arms.\n"

The ships of the foreigners were about 400 in number.\n\n\\NorwrrustaNbINc the superiority ofthe Persian fleet, Parmenio advised Alexander to fight\na sea-battle, expecting that the Greeks would be victorious with their fleet both for other\nreasons and especially because an omen from the deity made him confident of the result; for\nan eagle had been seen sitting upon the shore, opposite the stems of Alexander's ships.\"\nHe also urged that if they won the battle, they would reap a great advantage from it in regard\nto their main object in the war; and if they were beaten, their defeat would not be of any\n\u2018eat moment; for even as it was, the Persians held the sovereignty ofthe sea. He added that\nthe was willing t go on board the flet himself and to share the danger. However, Alexander\nreplied that Parmenio was mistaken in his judgment, and did not explain the sign according\u2019\nto probability. For it would be rash for him with a few ships to fight a batle against a fleet\nfar more numerous than his own, and with his unpracised naval force to contend against the\ndisciplined flet ofthe Cyprians and Phoenicians.

Many Grecian mercenary\nsoldiers had been left in the eity, as well as many Persian troops: the tiremes also were\nmoored in the harbour, so thatthe sailors might render him valuable aid in the operations.\n(On the first day of the siege, while Alexander was leading his men up to the wall in the\ndirection of the gate leading towards Mylasa,\" the men in the city made a sortie, and a\nskirmish took place; but Alexander's men making a rush upon them repulsed them with\ncease, and shut them up inthe city.

For he thought that if\nMyndus were his own, it would be no small help in the siege of Halicarnassus; moreover, an\noffer to surrender had been made by the Myndians if he would approach the town secretly,\nunder the cover of night. About midnight, therefore, he approached the wall, according to\nthe plan agreed on; but as no sign of surrender was made by the men within, and though he\nhhad with him no military engines or ladders, inasmuch as he had not set out to besiege the\ntown, but to receive it on surrender, he nevertheless led the Macedonian phalanx near and\n\u2018ordered them to undermine the wall. They threw down one of the towers, which, however,\nin its fall did not make a breach in the wall. But the men in the city stoutly defending\nthemselves, and atthe same time many from Hoalicamassus having already come to their aid\nby sea, made it impossible for Alexander to capture Myndus by surprise or sudden assault\nWherefore he retumed without accomplishing any of the plans for whieh he had set out, and\ndevoted himself once mote tothe siege of Halicarnassus\n\nIn the frst place he filled up with earth the ditch which the enemy had dug in front of|\nthe city, about thirty cubits wide and fifteen deep; so that it might be easy to bring forward\nthe towers, from which he intended to discharge missiles against the defenders of the wall,\nand that he might bring up the other engines with which he was planning to batter the wall\ndown, He easily filled up the ditch, and the towers were then brought forward, But the men\nin Halicamassus made a sally by night with the design of setting fire both to the towers and\nthe other engines which had been brought up to the wall, or were nearly brought up to it\n\u2018They were, however, easily repelled and shut up again within the walls by the Macedonians\nwho were guarding the engines, and by others who were aroused by the noise of the struggle\nand who came to their aid.

And 7\nit turned out just as he conjectured; for most of them retired, and only a guard remained.

Thence\nhe sailed to Lesbos and brought over to his side all the cities of the island,\u201d* except\nMitylene, the inhabitants of which did not submit to him. When he had gained these cities\n\u2018over, he turned is attention to Mitylene: and walling off the city from the rest of the island\nby constructing a double stockade from sea to sea, he easly got the mastery on the land side\nby building five camps. A part of his fleet guarded their hatbout, and, intercepting the ships\npassing by, he kept the rest of his fleet as a guard off Sigrium,\u201d\u201d the headland of Lesbos,\n\u2018where is the best landing-place for trading vessels from Chios, Geraestus,\u201d and Malea.*\"\nBy this means he deprived the Mitylenaeans of all hope of suecour by sea. But meantime he\nhimself fell ill and died, and his death at that ersis was exceedingly injurious tothe king's\ninterests. Nevertheless Autophradates, and Phamabazus, son of Artabazus, prosecuted the\nsiege with vigour. To the latte indeed, Memnon, when dying, had entrusted his command,\nas he was his sisters son, till Darius should come to some decision on the matter. The\nMitylenaeans, therefore, being excluded from the land, and being blockaded on the sea by\nmany ships Iying at anchor, sent to Pharnabazus and came to the following agreement:\u2014\n\u2018That the auxiliary troops which had come to their aid from Alexander should depart, that the\ncitizens should demolish the pillars on which the treaty made by them with Alexander was\ninseribed,\u201d\u201d that they should become allies of Darius on the terms of the peace which was\nmade with King Darius in the time of Antaeidas,\u201d and that their exiles should return from\nbanishment on condition of receiving back half the property which they possessed when\n\u2018they were banished. Upon these terms the compact was made between the Mitylenacans and\nthe Persians. But as soon as Pharnabazus and Autophradates once got within the city, they\nintroduced a garison with Lycomedes, a Rhodian, as its commandant. They also appointed\nDiogenes, one of the exiles, to be despot of the city, and exacted money from the\nMitylenacans, taking part of it by violence for themselves from the wealthy citizens, and\n"

The Tenedians preferred to be on terms of amity with Alexander and\nthe Greeks; but in the present crisis it seemed impossible to save themselves except by\nYielding to the Persians, since Hegelochus, who had been commissioned by Alexander to\ncollect another naval force, had not yet gathered so large a fleet as to warrant them in\nexpecting any speedy succour from him. Accordingly Pharnabazus made the Tenedians\n\u2018comply with his demands rather from fear than good-will.\n\nMeantime Proteas, son of Andronicus, by command of Antipater.\u201d succeeded in\ncollecting ships of war from Euboea and the Peloponnese, so that thete might be some\nprotection both for the islands and for Greece itself, if the foreigners attacked them by sea,\nas it was reported they intended to do.

As she herself was of the\nprophetic race, she instructed him to return to the very spot and offer sacrifice to Zeus the\nking. Gordius requested her to accompany him and direct him how to perform the sacrifice.\nHe offered the sacrifice inthe way the giel suggested, and afterwards marred her. Ason was\n\u2018bom to them named Midas, who, when he arrived at the age of maturity, was both\nhhandsome and valiant. At this time the Phrygians were harassed by civil discord, and &\nconsulting the oracle, they were told that a wagon would bring them a king, who would put\nan end to their discord.\u201d While they were still deliberating about this very matter, Midas\narrived with his father and mother, and stopped near the assembly with the very wagon in\n\u2018question. They, interpreting the oracular response o refer to hin, decided that this was the\nperson whom the god told them the wagon would bring. They therefore appointed Midas\nking; and he, putting an end to their discord, dedicated his father\u2019s wagon inthe citadel as 3\nthank-offering to Zeus the king for sending the eagle. In addition to this the following report\nwas current conceming the wagon, that whosoever eould loosen the cord with which the\nyoke of the wagon was tied, was destined to be the ruler of Asia. The cord was made of\n\u2018cornel bark, and neither end nor beginning to it could be seen. Its said by some that when\n\u2018Alexander could find out no way to loosen the cord and yet was unwilling to allow it to\nremain unloosened, lest it should exercise some disturbing influence upon the multitude, he\nstruck the cord with his sword and cut it through, saying that it had been untied by him. But\nAristobulus says that he pulled out the pin of the wagon-pole, which was a wooden peg\ndriven right through it, holding the cord together. Having done this, he drew out the yoke\nfrom the wagon-pole. How Alexander performed the feat in connection with this cord, I\ncannot affirm with confidence. At any rate both he and his troops departed from the wagon\nas ifthe oracular prediction concerning the untying of the cord had been fulfilled. Moreover,\nthat very night, the thunder and lightning were signs from heaven of is fulfilment; and for\nthis reason Alexander offered sacrifice on the following day to the gods who had revealed\n\u2018the signs and assured im thatthe cond had been untied ina proper way.\" \u00ae\nCHAPTER IV.\n\u2018Conauist oF Cappanocta.\u2014ALEXANDER'S ILLNESS at TARSUS.\n\u2018Tu next day he sent out to Aneyra\u00ae\" in Galatia, where he was met by an embassy from the\nPaphlagonians, offering to surrender their nation to him and to enter into an alliance with\nhhim; but they requested him not 10 invade their land with his forces. He therefore\ncommanded them to submit to the authority of Calas, the viceroy of Phrygia. Marching\nthence into Cappadocia, he subjugated all that part of it which lies on this sie of the river\nHalys.'\u00b0 and much of that which lies beyond it.

On the second day he passed through the Gates and\nencamped near the city of Myriandrus:* but in the night a heavy tempest and a violent\nstorm of wind and rain occurred which detained him in his eamp.

But the worse advice, because at the\nimmediate time it was more pleasant to hear, prevailed; moreover he was led by some\ndivine influence into that locality where he derived litle advantage from his cavalry and\nfrom the sheer number of his men, javelins and bows, and where he could not even exhibit\nthe mere magnificence of his army, but surrendered to Alexander and his troops an easy\nvictory.

Next day he proceeded to the river Pinarus. AS soon as\n\u2018Alexander heard that Darius was in his rear, because the news did not seem to him\n\u2018ustworthy, he embarked some of the Companions in ship with thirty oars, and sent them\nback to Issus, to observe whether the report was true...The men who sailed in the thiety-\n\u2018oared ship discovered the Persians encamped there more easily, because the sea in this part\ntakes the form of a bay: They therefore brought back word to Alexander that Darius was at\nhhand. Alexander then called together the generals, the commanders of cavalry, and the\nleaders of the Grecian alles, and exhorted them to take courage from the dangers which\nthey had already surmounted, asserting thatthe struggle would be between themselves who\nhnad been previously vietorious and a foe who had already been beaten; and thatthe deity\nwas acting the part of general on their behalf better than himself, by putting it into the mind\n\u2018of Darius to move his forces from the spacious plain and shut them up in a narrow place,\nWhere there was suficient room for them to deepen their phalanx by marching from front to\nrear, but where thei vast multitude would be useless to their enemy in battle. He added that\nthet foes were similar to them neither in strength nor in courage; for the Macedonians, who\nhnad long been practised in warlike toils aecompanied with danger, were coming into close\nconflict with Persians and Medes, men who had become encrvated by a long course of\nluxurious ease: and, to crown all, they, being freemen, were about to engage in battle with\nmen who were slaves. He said, moreover, that the Greeks who were in the two armies would\nnot be fighting forthe same objects; for those with Darius were braving danger for pay, and.\u2018\nthat pay not high; whereas, those on their side were voluntarily defending the interests of\nGreece. Again, of foreigners, the Thracians, Paeonians, Ilyrians, and Agrianians, who were\nthe most robust and warlike of men in Europe, were about to be arrayed against the most\nsluggish and effeminate races of Asia, In addition to allthis, Alexander was commanding in\nthe field against Darius. These things he enumerated as evidences oftheir superiority i the\nstrugee; and then he began to point out the great rewards they would win from the danger\nto be incurred. For he told them that on that occasion they would overcome, not merely the\nViceroys of Darius, nor the cavalry drawn up at the Granicus, nor the 20,000 Grecian\nmercenaries, but would overcome all the available forces ofthe Persians and Medes, as well\nasall the other races subject to them dwelling in Asia, and the Great King present in person.\n\u2018After this conflict nothing, would be left for them to do, except to take possession of all\n\u2018Asia, and to put an end to their many labours. In addition to this, he reminded them of their\nbrilliant achievements in their collective capacity in days gone by: and if any man had\nindividually performed any distinguished feat of valour from love of glory, he mentioned\nhim by name in commendation ofthe deed.\u201d He then recapitulated as modestly as possible\nhis own daring deeds in the various battles. He is also said to have reminded them of\n\u2018Xenophon and the ten thousand men who accompanied him, asserting thatthe latter were in\nho way comparable with them either in number or in general excellence. Besides, they had\nhhad with them neither Thessalian, Beeotian, Peloponnesian, Macedonian, or Thracian\nhorsemen, nor any of the other cavalry which was in the Macedonian army: nor had they\nany archers or slingers except a few Cretans and Rhodians, and even these were got ready\u2018\n\u2018by Xenophon on the spur of the moment in the very crisis of danger\"! And yet even these\n"

When about midnight\nhie had again got possession of it, he caused the army to rest the remainder ofthe night there\nupon the rocks, having posted vigilant sentres. At the approach of dawn he began to\ndescend from the pass along the road; and as long as the space was narrow everywhere, he\nled his army in column, but when the mountains parted so as to leave a plain between them,\nhhe kept on opening out the column into the phalanx, marching one line of heavy armed 9\ninfantry after another up into line towards the mountain on the right and towards the sea on\nthe left. Up to this time his cavalry had been ranged behind the infantry; but when they\nadvanced into the open country, he began to draw up his army in order of battle. First, upon\nthe right wing near the mountain he placed his infantry guard and the shield-bearers, under\nthe command of Nicanor, son of Parmenio: next to these the regiment of Coenus, and close\nto them that of Perdiecas\u201d These troops were posted as far as the middle of the heavy-armed\ninfantry t0 one beginning from the right. On the left wing first stood the regiment of\nAmyntas, then that of Ptolemy, and close to this that of Meleager. The infantry onthe left\nhhad been placed under the command of Craterus; but Parmenio held the chief direction of\nthe whole left wing. This general had been ordered not to abandon the sea, so that they\nmight not be surrounded by the foreigners, who were likely to outflank them on al sides by\n\u2018their superior numbers.\"\n\nBut as soon as Darius was certified of Alexander's approach for battle, he conveyed\nabout 30,000 of his cavalry and with them 20,000 of his light-armed infantry across the\nriver Pinarus, in order that he might be able to draw up the rest of his forces with ease. Of\nthe heavy armed infantry, he placed first the 30,000 Greek mercenaries to oppose the\nphalanx of the Macedonians, and on both sides ofthese he placed 60,000 of the men called\nCardaces.* who were also heavy-armed infantry ** For the place where they were posted  '\nwas able to contain only this number in a single phalanx.\u201d He also posted 20,000 men near\n\u2018the mountain on their left and facing Alexander's right. Some of these troops were also in\nthe rear of Alexander's army: for the mountain near which they were posted in one part\nsloped a great way back and formed a sort of bay, ike a bay in the sea, and afterwards\nbending forwards caused the men who had been posted at the foot of it to be behind\n\u2018Alexander's right wing. The remaining multitude of Darius\u2019s light-armed and heavy-armed\ninfantry was marshalled by nations to an unserviceable depth and placed behind the Grecian\nmercenaries and the Persian army arranged in phalanx. The whole of the army with Darius\nwas said to number about 600,000 fighting men.\u201d\n\n\u2018As Alexander advanced, he found that the ground spread out a litle in breadth, and he\naccordingly brought up his horsemen, both those called Companions, and the Thessalians as\nwell as the Macedonians, and posted them with himself on the right wing.

But when it began to grow dark and the ground before the feet became invisible,\n\nthe tured back again to the camp, after capturing the chariot of Darius with the shield, the\nMedian mantle, and the bow init For his pursuit had been too slow for him to overtake 1\nDarius, because, though he wheeled round at the frst braking asunder ofthe phalanx, yet\n\nthe didnot tur to pursue him until he observed thatthe Grecian mercenaries and the Persian\ncavalry had been driven away from the river.\n\n(Of the Persians were killed Arsames, Rheomithres, and Atizyes who had commanded\nthe cavalry at the Granicus. Sabaces, viceroy of Egypt, and Bubaces, one of the Persian\ndignitaries, were also Killed, besides about 100,000 of the private soldiers, among them\n\u2018being more than 10,000 cavalry.\" So great was the slaughter that Ptolemy, son of Lagus,\nwho then accompanied Alexander, says that the men who were with them pursuing Darius,\ncoming in the pursuit to a ravine, filled it up with the corpses and so passed over it.

The consequence was, that in the camp no more than 3,000 talents! were\ncaptured; and soon after, the money in Damaseus was also seized by Parmenio, who was\ndespatched thither for that very purpose.

They were also\ninstructed to support this petition by word of mouth. The letter pointed out to him that\nfriendship and alliance had subsisted between Philip and Artaxerses;\"* and that when\n\u2018Arses, son of Artaxerxes, ascended the throne, Philip was the frst practise injustice\ntowards him, though he had suffered no injury from the Persians.

For this reason he had come\ndown in person, to defend his country and to preserve the empire of his fathers. AS to the\nbattle, it had been decided as seemed good to some one of the gods. And now he, aking,\nbegged his captured wife, mother, and children from a king; and he wished to form a\nfriendship with him and become his ally. For this purpose he requested Alexander to send\nmen to him with Meniscus and Arsimas, the messengers who came from the Persians, to\nreceive pledges of fidelity from him and to give them on behalf of Alexander.\n\n\u201cTo this Alexander wrote a reply, and sent Thersippus with the men who had come from\nDarius, with instructions to give the letter to Darius, but not 10 converse about anything\n\u2018Alexander's letter ran thus: \u201cYour ancestors came into Macedonia and the rest of Greece\nfand treated us ill, without any previous injury from us. 1, having been appointed\ncommander-in-chief of the Greeks, and wishing to take revenge on the Persians, crossed\n\u2018over into Asia, hostilities being begun by you.

For their native eity had been redueed to slavery by the\nMacedonians, and they were trying to find whatever suceour they could for themselves and\nperhaps also for their native city from Darius and the Persians. Thinking thus\nCompassionately about both of them, he released them, saying that he dismissed\n\u2018Thessaliscus individually out of respect for his pedigree, for he belonged to the ranks ofthe\ndistinguished men of Thebes. Dionysodorus also he released because he had been conqueror\natthe Olympic games; and he kept Iphrirates in attendance on himself as long as he lived,\n\u2018reating him with special honour both from friendship to the city of Athens and from\nrecollection of his father's glory. When he died soon after from sickness, he sent his bones\nback to his relations at Athens. But Euthycles at first he kept in custody, though without\nfetters, both because he was a Lacedaemonian of a city at that time openly and eminently\nhostile to him, and because in the man as an individual he could find nothing to warrant his\npardon. Afterwards, when he met with great suecess, he released even this man also.\n\nHe set out from Marathus and took possession of Byblus\"\u201d on terms of capitulation, as\nhe did also of Sidon,\u201d the inhabitants of which spontaneously invited him from hatred of\nthe Persians and Darius.*\u2122 Thence he advanced towards Tyre;* ambassadors from which\ncity, despatched by the commonwealth, met him on the march, announcing thatthe Tyrians\nhhad decided to do whatever be might command.\u201d He commended both the eity and its\nambassadors, and ordered them to return and tell the Tyrians that he wished to enter their\ncity and offer sacrifice to Heracles.

It was not dedicated 10 the Argive\nHeracles, the son of Alemena; for this Heracles was honoured in Tyre many generations\nbefore Cadmus set out fom Phoenicia and occupied Thebes, and before Semele, the\ndaughter of Cadmus, was born, from whom Dionysus, the son of Zeus, was born. This\nDionysus would be third from Cadmus, being a contemporary of Labdacus, son of |\nPolydorus, the son of Cadmus; and the Argive Heracles lived about the time of Oedipus, son\n\u2018of Laius.\u00ae\u201d The Egyptians also worshipped another Heracles, not the one which either the\n\u2018Tyrians or Greeks worship. But Herodotus says that the Egyptians considered Heracles to be\n\u2018one of the twelve gods,\" just as the Athenians worshipped a different Dionysus, who was\nthe son of Zeus and Core; and the mystic chant called Lacchus was sung to this Dionysus,\nnot to th ligaturee Theban. So also I think thatthe Heracles honoured in Tartessus\u2122 by the\nTberians, where are certain pillars named after Heracles, isthe Tyrian Heracles: for Tartessus\nwas a colony of the Phetnicians, and the temple to Heracles there was built and the\nsacrifices offered after the usage of the Phenicians. Hecataeus the historian\u2019 says\nGeryones, against whom the Argive Heracles was despatched by Eurystheus to drive his\n\u2018oxen away and bring them to Mycenae, had nothing to do with the land of the Tberians:\"\"\nnor was Heracles despatched to any island called Erythia\u2122 outside the Great Sea; but that |\nGeryones was king of the mainland (Epirus) around Ambracia* and the Amphilochians,\nthat Heracles drove the oxen from this Epirus, and that this was deemed no mean task. 1\n\u2018know that to the present time this part of the mainland is rich in pasture land and rears a\nvery fine breed of oxen; and I do not think it beyond the bounds of probability that the fame\nof the oxen from Epirus, and the name of the king of Epirus, Geryones, had reached\nBurystheus. But I do not think that Eurystheus would know the name of the king of the\nIberian, who were the remotest nation in Europe, or whether afine breed of oxen grazed in\ntheir land, unless some one, by introducing Hera into the account, as herself giving these\ncommands to Heracles through Eurystheus, wished, by means of the fable, to disguise the\nincreibilty ofthe tale\n\n\u2018To this Tyrian Heracles, Alexander said he wished to offer sacrifice. But when this\nmessage was brought to Tyre by the ambassadors, the people passed a decree to obey any\n\u2018other command of Alexander, but not to admit into the city any Persian or Macedonian;\n\u2018thinking that under the existing circumstances, this was the most specious answer, and that\nit would be the safest course for them to pursue in reference tothe issue of the war, which\nwas sill uncertain.\u201d When the answer from Tyre was brought to Alexander, he sent the\nambassadors back in a rage. He then summoned a council of his Companions and the\nleaders of his army, together with the captains of infantry and cavalry, and spoke as follows:\n"

Moreover he\nwas encouraged by a divine admonition, for that very night in his sleep\u201d he seemed to be\napproaching the Tyrian walls, and Heracles seemed to take him by the right hand and lead\n\u2018him up into the ety. This was interpreted by Aristander\u2122 to mean that Tyre would be taken\nWith labour, because the deeds of Heracles were aecomplished with labour. Certainly, the\nsiege of Tyre appeared to be a great enterprise; for the city was an island\" and fortified all\nround with lofty walls. Moreover naval operations seemed at that time more favourable to\n\u2018the Tyrians, both because the Persians still possessed the sovereignty ofthe sea and many\nships were still remaining with the citizens themselves. However, as these arguments of his\nhhad prevailed, he resolved to construct a mole from the mainland tothe ety.\" The place is\n\u2018narrow strait full of pools; and the part of it near the mainland is shallow water and\nmuddy, but the part near the city itself, where was the deepest part of the channel, was the\ndepth of about three fathoms. But there was an abundant supply of stones and wood, which\n\u2018they put on the top of the stones.\" Stakes were easily fixed down firmly inthe mud, which\nitself served as a Cement tothe stones to hold them firm. The 2eal of the Macedonians in the\nwork was great, and it was increased by the presence of Alexander himself, who took the\nlead\u2019! in everything, now rousing the men to exertion by speech, and now by presents of\nmoney, lightening the labour of those who were toiling more than their fellows from the\ndesire of gaining praise for their exertions. As long as the mole was being constructed near\n\u2018the mainland, the work made easy and rapid progress, as the material was poured into a\nsmall depth of water, and there was no one to hinder them: but when they began to approach\nthe deeper water, and at the same time came near the city itself, they suffered severely,\nbeing assailed with missiles from the walls, which were lofty, inasmuch as they had been\nexpressly equipped for work rather than for fighting. Moreover, as the Tyrians still retained\ncommand of the sea, they kept on sailing with their trigemes to various parts of the mole,\nland made it impossible in many places for the Macedonians to pour inthe material. But the\nlatter erected two towers upon the mole, which they had now projected over a long stretch\n\u2018of sea, and upon these towers they placed engines of war. Skins and prepared hides served\nas coverings infront of them, to prevent them being struck by fire-bearing missiles from the\nWal, and atthe same time to be a sereen against arrows to those who were working. It was\nlikewise intended that the Tyrians who might sail near to injure the men engaged in the\nconstruction of the mole should not retire easily, being assailed by missiles from the towers.\n"

Alexander then was struck with wonder atthe place, and consulted\nthe oracle of the god. Having heard what was agreeable to his wishes, as he himself said, he\nset out on the journey back to Egypt by the same route, according to the statement of\nAristobulus; but aecording to that of Ptolemy, son of Lagus, he took another road, leading\nstraight to Memphis.\"\n"

The suceess ofthe Persians, on this occasion, was impeded especially by\nthis long standing on wateh with their arms, and by the fear which usually springs up before\n\u2018reat dangers; which, however, was not then suddenly aroused by a momentary panic, but\nhhad been experienced for a long time, and had thoroughly cowed theie spirits. The army\n\u2018of Darius was drawn up in the following manner: for, aecording to the statement of\nAristobulus, the written scheme of arrangement drawn up by Darius was afterwards |\ncaptured. His left wing was held by the Bactrian cavalry, in conjunetion with the Daans\u2018\u201d\nland Arachotians: near these had been posted the Petsians, horse and foot mixed together;\nnext to these the Susians, and then the Cadusians. This was the arrangement of the lft wing,\nas far as the middle of the whole phalanx. On the right had been posted the men from Coele-\nSyria and Mesopotamia. On the right again were the Medes: next to them the Parthians and\nSacians; then the Tapurians and Hyreanians, and last the Albanians and Sacesinians,\nextending as far as the middle of the whole phalanx. In the centre where King Darius was,\nhhad been posted the king\u2019s Kinsmen, the Persian guards carrying spears with golden\napples atthe butt end, the Indians, the Carians who had been forcibly removed to Central\n\u2018Asia, and the Mardian archers. The Uxians, the Babylonians, the men who dwvell near the\nRed Sea, and the Sitacenians had also been drawn up in deep column. On the left, opposite\n\u2018Alexander's right, had been posted the Scythian cavalry, about 1,000 Bactians and 100,\nseythe-bearing chariots. In front of Darius\u2019s royal squadron of cavalry stood the elephants\nand 50 chariots. In front of the right wing the Armenian and Cappadocian cavalry with $O\nseythe-bearing chariots had been posted. The Greek mercenaries, as lone capable of coping\nWith the Macedonians, were stationed right opposite their phalanx, in two divisions close |\n\u2018beside Darius himself and his Persian attendants, one division on each side.*\u201d\n\n\u2018Alexander's army was marshalled as follows: The right wing was held by the cavalry\n\u2018Companions, in feoat of whom had been posted the royal squadron, commanded by Clitus,\nson of Dropidas. Near this was the squadron of Gilaucias, next to it that of Aristo, then that\n\u2018of Sopolis, son of Hermodorus, then that of Heracides, son of Antiochus. Neat this was that\n"

This being done, Alexander ordered the cavalry of the Grecian mercenaries\nunder the command of Menidas to attack them. But the Seythian cavalry and the Bactrians,\nwho had been drawn up with them sallied forth against them, and being much more\nnumerous they put the small body of Greeks to rout. Alexander then ordered Aristo at the\nhhead of the Paconians and Grecian auxiliaries to attack the Seythians; and the barbarians\ngave way. But the rest of the Bactrians drawing near to the Paconians and Grecian\nauxiliaries, caused their own comrades who were already in flight to turn and renew the\nbattle; and thus they brought about a general cavalry engagement, in which many of\n\u2018Alexander's men fell not only being overwhelmed by the multitude of the barbarians, but\nalso because the Seythians themselves and their horses were much more completely\nprotected with armour for guarding their bodies\" Notwithstanding this, the Macedonians\nsustained their assaults, and assaling them violently squadron by squadron, they succeeded\nin pushing them out of rank.

In the frst place\nhe assaulted the fleeing cavalry of the enemy, the Parthians, some of the Indians, and the\nmost numerous and the bravest division of the Persians. Then ensued the most obstinately\ncontested cavalry fight in the whole engagement. For being drawn up by squadrons as it\nwere, the foreigners wheeled round and falling on Alexander's men face to face, they no\nlonger relied on the hurling of javelins or the dexterous deploying of horses, as is the\ncommon practice in cavalry battles, but every one on his own account strove eagerly to\n\u2018break through what stood in his way, as if this were their only means of safety. They struck\nand were struck without quarter, as if they were no longer struggling to secure the victory\nfor another, but were contending for their own personal safety. Here about sixty of\n\u2018Alexander's Companions fell; and Hephaestion himself, as well as Coenus and Menidas,\nwas wounded. But even these troops were overcome by Alexander; and as many of them as\ncould force their way through his ranks fled with all their might. And now Alexander had\nnearly come into conflict with the enemy\u2019s right wing, but in the meantime the Thessalian\ncavalry ina splendid struggle, had not fallen short of Alexander's success in the\nengagement, For the foreigners on the right wing were already beginning to fly when he\n\u2018came on the scene of conilit; so that he wheeled round again and started off in pursuit of\nDarius once more, Keeping up the chase as long as there was daylight. Parmenio's brigade\nalso followed in pursuit of those who were opposed to them. But Alexander erossed the\nriver Lycus\u2018 and pitched his eamp there, o give his men and horses a litle rest; while\nParmenio seized the Persian camp with their baggage, elephants, and camels. After giving\nhis horsemen rest until midnight, Alexander again advanced by a forced march towards\nArbela, with the hope of seizing Darius there, together with his money and the rest of his\nroyal property. He reached Atbela the next day, having pursued altogether about 600 stades\nfrom the battle-field.\u201c* But as Darius went on fleeing without taking any rest, he did not\nfind him at Arbela.

Having divided his army into three parts, he himself led\nthe way by the shortest and most difficult route, atthe head of the most numerous and atthe\nsame time the lightest division of his forees. He despatched Craters atthe head of his own\nbrigade and that of Amyntas, some of the archers, and a few of the cavalry against the\n\u2018Tapurians; and he ordered Erigyius to take the Grecian mercenaries and the rest of the\ncavalry, and lead the way by the public thoroughfare, though it was longer, conducting the\nwagzons, the baggage, and the crowd of camp-followers. After erossing the first mountains,\nand encamping there, he took the shield-bearing guards together with the lightest men inthe\nMacedonian phalanx and some of the archers, and went along a road difficult and hard to\n\u2018ravel upon, leaving guards for the roads wherever he thought there was any peril, so that\n\u2018the barbarians who held the mountains might not at those points fall upon the men who were\nfollowing. Having passed through the defies with his archers, he encamped in the plain near\n4 small river\"; and while he was here, Nabarzanes, the commander of Darius\u2019s cavalry,\nPhataphernes, the viceroy of Hytcania and Parthia, and the other most distinguished of the\nPersians in attendance on Darius, arrived and surrendered themselves. After waiting four\ndays in the camp, he took up those who had been left behind on the march, all of them\nadvancing in safety except the Agrianians, who, while guarding the rear, were attacked by\n\u2018the barbarian mountaineers. But these soon drew off when they got the worst of it in the\nskirmish. Starting from this place, he advanced into Hyrcania as far as Zadracarta, the\ncapital of the Hyreanians. In this place\u201c he was rejoined by Craterus, who had not\nsucceeded in falling in with the Grecian mercenaries of Darius; but he had thoroughly\ntraversed the whole country, gaining over part of it by force and the other part by the\nVoluntary capitulation of the inhabitants. Erigyius also arrived here with the baggage and\nwaggons; and soon after Artabazus\"\u00ae came to Alexander with three of his sons, Cophen,\nAriobarzanes, and Arsames, accompanied by Autophradates, viceroy of Tapuria, and envoys,\nfrom the Grecian mercenaries in the service of Darius. To Autophradates he restored his\nViceregal office; but Artabazus and his sons he kept near himself in a position of honour,\n\u2018both on account of their fidelity to Darius and because they were among the frst nobles of\nPersia. To the envoys from the Greeks, besging him to make a truce with them on behalf of\nthe whole mercenary force, he replied that he would not make any agreement with them;\nbecause they were acting with great guilt in serving as soldiers on the side of the barbarians\nagainst Greece, in contravention of the resolution of the Greeks. He commanded them to\ncome in a body and surrender, leaving it to him to treat them as he pleased, or to preserve\nthemselves as best they could. The envoys said that they yielded both themselves and their\ncomrades to Alexander, and urged him to send some one with them to act as their leader, so\nthat they\u2019 might be conducted to him with safety. They said they were 1,500 in number.\n\u2018Accordingly he sent Andronicus, son of Agerthus, and Artabazus to them,\n"

No\n\u2018one for along time had invaded their land in a hostile manner, not only on account ofits\nruggedness, but also because the people were poor, and besides being poor were warlike\n\u2018Therefore they never feared that Alexander would attack them, especially as he had already\nadvanced further than their country. For this reason they were caught more easily off their\n\u2018guard, Many of them, however, escaped into the mountains, which in their land are very\nlofty and eragey, thinking that Alexander would not penetrate to these at any rate. But when\nhhe was approaching them even here, they sent envoys to surrender both the people and their\nland to him. He pardoned them, and appointed Autophradates, whom he had also recently\nplaced over the Tapurians, viceroy over them.

According to the account of Aristobulus,\nMount Caucasus is as lofty as any in Asia, and most of itis bare, at any rate in that part\n\u2018where Alexander crossed it. This range of mountains stretches out so far that they say even\n\u2018that Mount Taurus, which forms the boundary of Cilicia and Pamphyli, springs feom it, as\ndo other great ranges which have been distinguished from the Caucasus by various names!\naccording tothe position of each, Aristobulus says that in this part ofthe Caucasus nothing\n\u2018grew except terebinth trees and silphium:* notwithstanding which, it was inhabited by\nmany people, and many sheep and oxen graze there; because sheep are very fond of\nsilphium. For if a sheep smells it even from a distance, it runs to it and feeds upon the\nflower. They also dig up the root, which is devoured by the sheep. For this reason in\nCyrene,*\u201d some drive their flocks as far as possible away from the places where their\nsilphium is growing; others even enclose the place with a fence, so that even if the sheep\nshould approach it they would not be able to get within the enclosure. For the silphium is\nVery valuable tothe Cyrenacans.\n\nBessus, accompanied by the Persians who had taken part with him in the seizure of\nDarius, and by 7,000 of the Bactrians themselves and the Daans who dwelt on this side the\n\u2018Tanais,** was laying waste the country atthe foot of Mount Caucasus, in order to prevent\n\u2018Alexander from marching any futher, both by the desolation of the land between the enemy\nland himself and by the lack of provisions. But none the less did Alexander keep up the\nmarch, though with difficulty, both on account of the deep snow and from the want of\nnecessaries; but yet he persevered in his journey. When Bessus was informed that Alexander\n\u2018was now not fr off, he crossed the river Onus,\"\u201d and having burnt the boats upon which he!\nhhad crossed, he withdrew to Nautaca\u2122\" in the land of Sogdiana. He was followed by\nSpitamenes and Oxyartes, with the cavalry ftom Sogdiana, as well as by the Daans from the\n\u201cTanais.

Thus did Ptolemy. When Alexander saw\nBessus, he caused his chariot to stop, and asked him, for what reason he had in the frst\nplace arrested Darius, his own king, who was also his kinsman and benefactor, and then led\nhhim as a prisoner in chains, and at last killed him?

Some of them were Wounded by the missiles, and one was struck right through\nthe wicker-shield and breastplate and fell from his horse, The others, being alarmed at the\ndischarge of missles from so great a distance, and atthe death of their champion, etreated a\nlitle from the bank. But Alexander, seeing them thrown into confusion by the effect of his\nmissiles, began to cross the river with trumpets sounding, himself leading the way; and the\nrest of the army followed him. Having first got the archers and slingers across, he ordered\nthem to sling and shoot at the Seythians, to prevent them approaching the\u2019 phalanx of\ninfantry stepping out of the water, until all his cavalry had passed over. When they were\nupon the bank in dense mass, he first of all aunched against the Seythians one regiment of\nthe Grecian auxiliary eavalry and four squadrons of pike-men. These the Scythians received,\nand in great numbers riding round them in cigcles, wounded them, as they were few in\nnumber, themselves escaping with ease. But Alexander mixed the archers, the Agrianians, 2\nand other light troops under the command of Balaerus, with the cavalry, and then led them\nagainst the enemy. As soon as they came to close quarters, he ordered three regiments of the\ncavalry Companions and all the horse-lancers to charge them.

Then the flight of the Seythians was\nalready apparent. 1,000 of them fell, including Satraces, one of their chiefs; and 150 were\ncaptured. But as the pursuit was keen and fatiguing on account of the excessive heat, the\ncentre army was seized with thist; and Alexander himself while riding drank of such water\nas was procurable in that country.

It was\nWell known that Clitus had long been vexed at Alexander for the change in his style of\nliving in imitation of foreign kings, and at those who flatered him with thir speech. At that\ntime also, being heated with wine, he would not permit them either to insult the deity or, by\ndepreciating the deeds of the ancient heroes, to confer upon Alexander a gratification which\ndeserved n0 thanks. He affirmed Alexander's deeds were neither in fact so great or\nmarvellous as they represented in their laudation; nor had he achieved them by himself, bt\nfor the most part they were the deeds of the Macedonians. The delivery of this speech\nannoyed Alexander; and I do not commend it, for I think, in such a drunken bout, it would\nhhave been sufficient if, so far as he was personally concemed, he had kept silence, and not\ncommitted the error of indulging in the same flattery as the others. But when some even\nmentioned Philip's actions without exercising a just judgment, declaring that he had\nperformed nothing great or marvellous, they gratified Alexander; but Clitus being then no\nlonger able to contain himself, began to put Philip\u2019s achievements in the first rank, and to\ndepreciate Alexander and his performances.\u201c Clits being now quite intoxicated, made 2\n\u2018other insolent remarks and even greatly reviled him, because forsooth he had saved his life,\nWhen the cavalry battle had been fought with the Persians atthe Granicus.

He was however restrained by his boon-\ncompanions. As Clitus did not desist from his insulting remarks, Alexander shouted out a\nsummons for his shiekd-bearing guards to attend him; but when no one obeyed him, he said\nthat he was reduced to the same positon as Darius, when he was led about under arrest by\nBessus and his adherents, and that he now possessed the mete name of king. Then his\ncompanions were no longer able to restrain him; for according to some he leaped up and\nsnatched a javelin from one of his confidential body-guards; aveording to others, along pike\nfrom one of his ordinary guards, with which he struck Clitus and Killed him. Aristobulus\ndoes not say whence the drunken quarrel originated, but asserts thatthe fault was entirely on\nthe side of Clitus, who, when Alexander had got so enraged with him as to jump up against\n\u2018him withthe intention of making an end of him, was led away by Ptolemy, son of Lagus, the\nconfidential body-guard, through the gateway, beyond the wall and ditch of the citadel\nWhere the quarrel occurred.

Most historians do not mention tis, but\nsay that he went off to bed and lay there lamenting, calling Clitus himself by name, and his\nsister Lanice, daughter of Dropidas, who had been his nurse. He exclaimed that having\nreached man\u2019s estate he had forsooth bestowed on her a noble reward for her care in rearing\nhim, as she lived to see her own sons die fighting on his behalf, and the king slaying her\nbrother with his own hand.** He did not cease calling himself the murderer of his friends;\nand for three days rigidly abstained trom food and drink, and paid no attention whatever to\nhis personal appearance. Some of the soothsayers revealed that the avenging wrath of\nDionysus had been the cause of his conduct, because he had omitted the sacrifice to that\ndeity.\u201c At last with great difficulty he was induced by his companions to touch food and to\n\u2018ay proper attention to His person.\u201c He then paid to Dionysus the sacrifice due to him,\u00bb\nsince he was not at all unwilling to attribute the fatality rather to the avenging wrath of the\ndeity than to his own depravity think Alexander deserves great praise for this, that he did\nnot obstinately persevere in evil, or still worse become a defender and advocate of the\nwrong which had been done, but confessed that he had committed a erime, being a man and\nnot a god. There are some who say that Anaxarchus the Sophist\u2122* was summoned into\n\u2018Alexander's presence to give him consolation. Finding him lying down and groaning, he\nlaughed at him, and said that he did not know that the wise men of old for this reason made\nJustice an assessor of Zeus, because whatever was done by him was justly done\u201d; and\ntherefore also that which was done by the Great King ought to be deemed just, inthe frst\nplace by the king himself, and then by the rest of men. They say that Alexander was then\n\u2018greatly consoled by these remarks. But I assert that Anaxarchus did Alexander a great\ninjury and one stil greater than that by which he was then oppressed, if he really thought\ntis to be the opinion of a wise man, that forsooth it is proper fora king to come to hasty\nconclusions and act unjustly, and that whatever is done by a king must be deemed just, no.\nmatter how itis done. There is also a curtent report that Alexander wished men to prostrate\nthemselves before him as toa god, entertaining the notion that Ammon was his father, rather\nthan Philip; and that he now showed his admiration of the customs of the Persians and\nMedes by changing the style of his dress, and by the alteration he made in the general\netiquette of his court. There were not wanting those who in regard to these matters gave way\nto his wishes with the design of flattering him; among others being Anaxarchus, one of the\nphilosophers attending his court, and Agis, an Argive who was an epic poet.\u201d\nCHAPTER X.\nDispute neTWrEN CALLISTHENES AND ANAXARCHUS,\n\nBur itis said that Callishenes the Olynthian, who had studied philosophy under Aristotle,\nand was somewhat brusque in is manner, did not approve of this conduct: and so far as this,\nis concemed I quite agree with him.

But Callsthenes interposed and said:\u2014\u201cO Anaxarchus, | openly declare that there\nis no honour which Alexander is unworthy to receive, provided that it is consistent with his\n\u2018being human; but men have made distinctions between those honours which are due to men,\nand those due to gods, in many different ways, as for instance by the building of temples\nand by the erection of statues. Moreover for the gods sacred enclosures are selected, to them\nsacrifie is offered, and to them libations are made. Hymns also are composed in honour of\nthe gods, and eulogies for men. But the greatest distinction is made by the custom of\nprostration, For its the practice that men should be kissed by those who salute them\u2019; but\n\u2018because the deity i located somewhere above, itis not lawl even to touch him, and this is,\nthe reason no doubt why he is honoured by prostration. Bands of choral dancers are also\nappointed forthe gods, and paeans are sung in their honour. And this isnot at all wonderful,\nseeing that certain honours are specially assigned to some of the gods and certain others to\nother gods, and, by Zeus, quite different ones again are assigned to heroes, which are very\ndistinct from those paid to the deities.\u201d I is not therefore reasonable to confound all these\ndistinctions without discrimination, exalting men to a rank above their condition by\nextravagant accumulation of honours, and debasing the gods, as far as les in human power,\nto an unseemly level, by paying them honours only equal to those paid to men.\u201d He said that\n\u2018Alexander would not endute the affront, if some private individual were to be thrust into his\nroyal honours by an unjust vot, either by show of hand or by ballot. Much more justly then\nwould the gods be indignant at those mortals who usuep divine honours or suffer themselves\nto be thrust into them by others. \u201cAlexander not only seems to be, but is in reality beyond\nany competition the bravest of brave men, of kings the most kingly, and of generals the most\nworthy to command an army. O Anaxarchus, it was thy duty, rather than any other man\u2019s, to\n\u2018become the special advocate ofthese arguments now adduced by me, and the opponent of\n\u2018those contrary o them, seeing that thou associatest with him for the purpose of imparting\nphilosophy and instruction.

But after the discussion silence ensued; and then the most honourable of the\nPersians arose in due order and prostrated their bodies before him.

But when the pledging of health\ncame to the turn of Callisthenes, he rose up and drank fom the goblet, and drew near,\nwishing to kiss the king without performing the at of prostration. Alexander happened then\nto be conversing with Hephaestion, and consequently did not observe whether Callisthenes\nperformed the ceremony properly or not. But when Callsthenes was approaching to kiss\nhim, Demetrius, son of Pythonax, one of the Companions, said that he was doing so without\nhaving prostrated himseif. So the king would not permit him to kiss him; whereupon the\nphilosopher said:\u2014\u201cI am going away only withthe loss of a kiss\u201d I by no means approve 2\nany ofthese proceedings, which manifested both the insolence of Alexander on the present\n\u2018occasion and the churlish nature of Calisthenes.

These youths were entrusted with the general attendance on the king's person\nand the protection of his body while he was asleep. Whenever the king rode out, some of\nthem received the horses from the grooms, and brought them to him, and others assisted him\n\u2018to mount in the Persian fashion. They were also companions ofthe king in the emulation of 2\nthe chase.*\u00ae Among these youths was Hermolalis, son of Sopolis, who seemed to be\napplying his mind to the study of philosophy, and to be cultivating the society of\nCallisthenes for this purpose. There is current a tale about this youth to the effect that inthe\nchase, a boar rushed at Alexander, and that Hermolais anticipated him by casting a javelin\nat the beast, by which it was smitten and killed. But Alexander, having lot the opportunity\nof distinguishing himself by being too late in the assault, was indignant with Hermolais,\nand in his wrath ordered him to receive a scourging in sight of the other pages: and also\ndeprived him of his horse. This Hermolais, being chagrined at the disgrace he had incurred,\ntold Sostratus, son of Amynias, who was his equal in age and intimate confidential friend,\nthat life would be insupportable to him unless he could take vengeance upon Alexander for\nthe affront. He easily persuaded Sostratus to join in the enterprise, since he was fondly\nattached to him. They gained over to their plans Antipater, son of Asclepiodorus, viceroy of\nSyria, Epimenes son of Arseas, Antcles son of Theoertus, and Philotas son of Carsis the\nThracian. They therefore agreed to Kill the king by attacking him in his sleep, on the night\nWhen the nocturnal watch came round to Antipate\u2019s tum, Some say that Alexander\naccidentally happened to be drinking until daybreak; but Aristobulus has given the\nfollowing account: A Syrian woman, who was under the inspiration of the deity, used to\nfollow Alexander about. At fist she was a subject of mirth to Alexander and his courtiers;\n\u2018but when all that she said in her inspiration was seen to be true, he no longer treated her 2\nwith neplet, but she was allowed to have free access to him both by night and day, and she\noften took her stand near him even when he was asleep. And indeed on that occasion, when\nthe was withdrawing from the drinking-party she met him, being under the inspiration ofthe\ndeity atthe time, and besought him to retum and drink all night. Alexander, thinking that\nthere was something divine in the warning, returned and went on drinking: and thus the\nenterprise of the pages fell through! The next day, Epimenes son of Arseas, one of those\nWho took part in the conspiracy, spoke of the undertaking to Chaticles son of Menander,\nwho had become his confidential friend: and Charicles told it to Eurylochus, brother of\nEpimenes. Eurylochus went to Alexander\u2019 tent and related the whole affair to Ptolemy son\n\u2018of Lagus, one ofthe confidential body-guards. He told Alexander, who ordered those whose\nnames had been mentioned by Eurylochus to be arrested.

Of the Scythians, 150 horsemen were slain; but the rest of\nthem easly escaped into the desert, for it was impossible for the Macedonians to pursue\nthem any further. At this time, Alexander relieved Artabazus of the viceroyally of the\nBactrians, at his own request, on the ground of his advanced age; and Amyntas, son of\n\u2018Nicolas, was appointed viceroy in his stead.\u00b0\u201d\u201d Coenus was left with his own brigade and >\nthat of Meleager, 400 of the Companion cavalry, and all the horse-archers, besides the\nBactrians, Sogdianians, and others who were under the command of Amyntas.

When Darius saw this man, his first inquiry was, whether his\nchildren, wife, and mother were alive? Ascertaining that they were not only alive, but were\ncalled queens, and enjoyed the same personal service and attention which they had been\naccustomed to have with Darius, he thereupon made a second inquiry, whether his wife was\nstill chaste? When he ascertained that she remained so, he asked again whether Alexander\nhad not offered any violence to her to gratify his lust? The eunuch took an oath and said: \u201cO\nking, thy wie is just as thou didst leave her; and Alexander is the best and most chaste of\nmen.\u201d Upon this Darius stretched his hands towards heaven and prayed as follows:\u2014\"O\nKing Zeus,\u201d to whom power has been assigned to regulate the affair of kings among men,\ndo thou now protect for me espevally the empire of the Persians and Medes, as indeed thou.\ndidst give itto me.

When he arrived, the king gave him\n4 courteous answer 10 his inquires, and retained him after pledging his fidelity and\nfriendship. But he bade him send to the rock some of those who came down with him to\n\u2018order his men to surrender the place; and it was surrendered by those who had fled to it for\nrefuge. Alexander therefore took 500 of his shield-bearing guards and went up to get a view\nOf the rock; and was s0 far from infieting any harsh teatment upon Chorienes tht he\nentrusted that very place 10 him again, and made him governor of all that he had ruled\n\u2018before It happened thatthe army suffered much hardship from the severity ofthe winter,\n{great quantity of snow having fallen during the siege; while atthe same time the men were\nreduced to gat straits from lack of provisions.

When he had given them this, he said he had not exhausted even the\ntenth part of what had been laid up forthe siege.

I cannot\naffirm with confidence either way, whether the Theban, Tyrian, or Egyptian Heracles\npenetrated into India or no; but Iam rather inclined to think that he did not penetrate so far;\nfor men are wont to magnify the difficulty of difficult enterprises to such a degree as to\nassert that they would have been impracticable even to Heracles. Therefore, Iam inclined to\n\u2018think, that in regard to this rock the name of Heracles was mentioned simply to add to the\nmarvellousness of the tale. The circuit ofthe rock is said to be about 200 stades (i.e. about\ntwenty-three miles), and its height where itis lowest, eleven stades (i.e, about a mile and a\nquarter), There was only one ascent, which was artificial and difficult, on the sumamit ofthe\nrock there was abundance of pure water a spring issuing from the ground, from whieh the\nwater flowed: and there was also timber, and sufficient good arable land for 1,000 men to\nUilL\u00b0 When Alexander heard this, he was seized with a vehement desire to capture this,\nmountain also, especially on account of the legend which was current about Heracles.

With these he sent Ptolemy, son of Lagus, the\nconfidential body-guard, in command of the Agranians and the other light-armed twoops,\ntogether with picked men fom the shield-bearing guards. He gave ths oficer instructions,\n4s soon as e had got possession of the plac, to Occupy it witha song guard, and signal\nhh that it as held. Prolemy proceeded along a road which was rough and difficult to pass,\nand occupied the position without the knowledge ofthe barbarians. After strengthening his\nPosition With a stockade and a ditch all round, he raised a beacon from the mountain,\nWhence it was likely to be seen by Alexander: The flame was at once seen, and on the\nfollowing day the king led his army forwatd; but asthe barbarians disputed his advance, he\ncould do nothing further on account of the difficult nature of the ground. When the\nbarbarians perceived that Alexander could not make an assault, they tamed round and\nautacked Ptolemy, and a sharp batle ensued between them and the Macedonians, the Indians\nmaking pret efforts to demolish the stockade, and Prolemy to preserve his position. But the\nbarbarians, geting the worst of it in the skirmish, withdrew as the night carne on. Alexander\nnow selected from the Indian deserters a man who was not only devoted to him but\nacquainted withthe locality.\u201d and sent him by aight to Ptolemy, carrying a lte, in which\nit was writen that as soon as the king attacked the rock, Prolemy was to come down the\nmountain upon the barbarians, and not be contented with holding his positon in guard; so\nthat the Indians, being assailed feom both sides at once, might be in perplexity what course\nto pursue. Accordinal, starting from his eamp at daybreak, he led hs army up the path by\nwhich Ptolemy\u2019 bad ascended by stealth, entertaining the opinion that if he could force his\n\u2018vay in this direction and join his forces with those of Polemy, the work would no longer be\ndifficult for im; and so it turned out. For until midday a smart batle was kept up between\nthe Indians and the Macedonians, the latter striving to force a way of approach, and the\nformer hurling missiles at them as they ascended. But as the Macedonians did not relax their\nefforts, advancing one after another, and those who were in advance rested ill their\ncomrades came up, afler great exertions they gained possession of the pass early in the\naflemoon, and formed a junction with Ptolemy\u2019 frees. As the whole amy was now united,\n\u2018Alexander led it thence against the rock itself. Bu the approach to it was still impracticable.\nSuch then was the result of this day's labours. At the approach of the dawn he issued an\n\u2018order that each soldier individually should cut 100 stakes; and when this had been done be\nhncaped up great mound against the rock, beginning from the top ofthe hill where they had\n\u2018encamped. From this mound he thought the rows as well asthe missiles launched from the\nmilitary engines would be able t reach the defenders of the rock. Every one in the army\nassisted him in this work of raising the mound; while he himself superintended it, as an\n\u2018observer, aot only commending the man who completed his task with zeal and alarty, but\n\u2018also chastising him who was dilatory in the pressing emergency.\n"

Without taking any rest,\n\u2018Alexander went on with the mound, being desious of connecting his artificial rampart with\nthe eminence which the few men were now occupying for him. But then the Indians, being\nalarmed at the indescribable audacity of the Macedonians, who had forced their way to the\neminence, and seeing that the mound was already united with it, desisted from attempting\nany longer to resist. They sent their herald to Alexander, saying that they were willing 0\nsurrender the rock, if he would grant them a truce. But they had formed the design of\nwasting the day by continually delaying the ratification of the truce, and of scattering\nthemselves in the night with the view of escaping one by one to their own abodes.

Others reteating with panic terror perished by leaping down the\nprecipices; and thus the rock which had been inexpugnable to Heracles was occupied by\n\u2018Alexander. He offered sacrifice upon it, and arranged a fort, committing the superintendence\n\u2018of the garrison to Sisicottus, who long before had deserted from the Indians to Bessus in\nBactra, and after Alexander had acquired possession of the country of Baca, entered his\narmy and appeared to be eminently trustworthy.\n\nHe now set out from the rock and invaded the land of the Assacenians; for he was\ninformed that the brother of Assacenus, with his elephants and many of the neighbouring\nbarbarians had fled into the mountains in this district.

They were despatched\nboth to reconnoitre the locality and to ty if they could capture some of the barbarians\nanywhere in order to get information about the general afais of the country: and he was\nespecially anxious to learn news of the elephants. He now directed his march towards the\nriver Indus, the army going in advance to make a road for him, as otherwise this district\nwould have been impassable, Here he captured a few of the barbarians, from whom he\nlearnt that the Indians ofthat land had fled for safety to Abisares, but that they had left their\nelephants there to pasture near the river Indus.

The report is, that its foundation was the\n\u2018work of Dionysus, who built it after he had subjugated the Indians. But itis impossible to\ndetermine who this Dionysus\" was, and at what time, or from what quarter he led an army\n\u2018against the Indians. For Tam unable to devide whether the Theban Dionysus, starting from\n\u2018Thebes oF from the Lydian Tmolus' came into India at the head of an army, and after\ntraversing the territories of so many warlike nations, unknown to the Greeks of that time,\nforcibly subjugated none of them except that of the Indians. But I do not think we ought to\nmake a minute examination of the legends which were promulgated in ancient times about\nthe divinity; for things which are not eredible to the man who examines them according to\nthe rule of probability, do not appear to be wholly incredible, if one adds the divine agency 2+\nto the story. When Alexander came to Nysa the citizens sent out to him their president,\n\u2018whose name was Acuphis, accompanied by thirty of their most distinguished men as\nenvoys, 10 entreat Alexander to leave thei city free for the sake of the god. The envoys,\ncentered Alexander's tent and found him seated in his armour still eovered with dust from the\njourney, with his helmet on his head, and holding his spear in his hand. When they beheld\nthe sight they were struck with astonishment, and falling to the earth remained silent along\ntime. But when Alexander caused them to rise, and bade them be of good courage, then at\nlength Acuphis began thus to speak: \u201cThe Nysaeans beseech thee, O king, out of respect for\nDionysus, to allow them to remain free and independent for when Dionysus had subjugated\n\u2018the nation of the Indians, and was returning tothe Grecian sea, he founded this city from the\nsoldiers who had become unfit for miliary service, and were under his inspiration as\nBacchanals, so tat it might be a monument both of his wandering and of hs vietory, to men\nof afer times; just as thou also hast founded Alexandria near mount Caucasus, and another\n\u2018Alexandria in the country of the Egyptians. Many other cities thou hast already founded,\nland others thou wilt found hereafer, in the course of time, inasmuch as thou hast achieved\nmore exploits than Dionysus. The god indeed called the city Nysa, and the land Nysaea ater\nhis nurse Nysa. The mountain also which is near the city he named Meros (i. thigh),\nbecause, according to the legend, he grew in the thigh of Zeus. From that time we inhabit\n[Nysa, a five eity, and we ourselves are independent, conducting our government with\nconstitutional order. And let this be to thee a proof that our eity owes its foundation to\nDionysus; for ivy, which does not grow in the rest of the country of India, grows among us.\u201d\n\nCHAPTER IL\n\nALExanpeR at N\u00a5SA.\n\n\u2018AL this was very pleasant to Alexander to heat; for he wished thatthe legend about the\n\u2018wandering of Dionysus should be believed, as well as that Nysa owed its foundation to that\ndeity since he had himself reached the place where Dionysus came, and had even advanced\nbeyond the limits of the latter's march.

The Indus isthe largest of all the rivers in Asia and Europe,\nexcept the Ganges,\u201d which is also an Indian river. It takes its rise on this side mount\nParapamisus, oF Caucasus, and discharges its water into the Great Sea whieh lies near India\nin the direction of the south wind. It has two mouths, both of which outlets are full of\nshallow pools like the five outlets of the Ister (or Danube) I forms a Delta in the land of\nthe Indians resembling that of Egypt; and tis is called Pattala in the Indian language. The\nHydaspes, Acesines, Hydraotes, and Hyphasis are also Indian rivers, and far exceed the\nother rivers of Asia in size; but they are not only smaller but much smaller than the Indus,\njust as that river itself is smaller than the Ganges. Indeed Ctesias\u2122' says (if any one thinks\nhis evidence to be depended upon), that where the Indus is narrowest, its banks are forty\nstades apart; where itis broadest, 100 stades; and most of itis the mean between these\nbreadths.\"\u00b0 This river Indus Alexander crossed at daybreak with his army into the country\nof the Indians; conceming whom, in this history I have described neither what laws they\n\u2018enjoy; nor what strange animals their land produces, nor how many and what sort of fish and\n\u2018water-monsters are produced by the Indus, Hydaspes, Ganges, ofthe other rivers of India,\n[Nor have I described the ants which dig up the gold for them,\u201c nor the guardian griffins,\nnor any of the other tales that have been composed rather to amuse than to be received as\nthe relation of facts; since the falsity of the strange stories which have been fabricated about\nIndia cannot be exposed by any one.\u201c However, Alexander and those who served in his\narmy exposed the falsity of most ofthese tales; but there were even some of these very men\n\u2018who fabricated other stories. They proved thatthe Indians whom Alexander visited with his\narmy, and he visited many tribes of them, were destitute of gold; and also that they were by\n\u2018no means luxurious in their mode of living. Moreover, they discovered that they were tall in\nstature, in fact as tall as any men throughout Asia, most of them being five cubits in height,\n\u2018or a litle less. They were blacker than the rest of men, except the Ethiopians\u201c; and in war\nthey were far the bravest ofall the raves inhabiting Asia at that time. For I cannot with any\njustice compare the race of the ancient Persians with those of India, though at the head of\nthe former Cyrus, son of Cambyses, set out and deprived the Medes of the empire of Asia,\nand subdued many other races partly by force and partly by voluntary surrender on theit\n\u2018own part. For at that time the Persians were a poor people and inhabitants of a rugged land,\nhhaving laws and customs very similar to the Laconian discipline\u2019 Nor am 1 able with\ncertainty to conjecture whether the defeat sustained by the Persians in the Seythian land was\n\u2018due tothe difficult nature of the country invaded or to some other error on the part of Cyrus,\n\u2018or whether the Persians were really inferior in wake matters to the Seythians of that\ndistrict.\n"

As soon as any one of these vessels as been held fast,\nanother is inthe same way moored with its prow against the stream, distant from the first as\nfar as is consistent with their supporting what is put upon them. On both of them are placed\npieces of timber with sharp ends projecting out, on which eross-planks are placed to bind\n\u2018them together; and so proceeds the work through all the vessels which are required to bridge\nthe river.

But as soon as he had ascertained with accuracy the number of the Indians, he\nimmediately made a rapid charge upon them with the cavalry around him. When they\nperceived that Alexander himself and the body of cavalry around him had made the assault,\nnot in line of battle regularly formed, but by squadrons, they gave way; and 400 of their\ncavalry, including the son of Porus, fell in the contest. The chariots also were captured,\nhorses and all, being heavy and slow in the retreat, and useless in the action itself on\naccount of the clayey grourid, When the horsemen who had escaped from this rout brought\nnews to Porus that Alexander himself had erossed the river with the strongest part of his\n\u2018army, and that his son had been slain in the battle, he nevertheless could not make up his\nmind what course to take, because the men who had been left behind under Craterus were\nseen to be attempting to cross the river from the great camp which was directly opposite his\nposition, However, at lst he preferred to march against Alexander himself with all his army,\nand to come into a decisive conflict with the strongest division of the Macedonians,\n\u2018commanded by the king in person, But nevertheless he left a few of the elephants together\nWith a small army there at the camp to frighten the cavalry under Craterus from the bank of\nthe river, He then took all his cavalry to the aumber of 4,000 men, all his chariots to the\nnumber of 300, with 200 of his elephants and 30,000 choice infantry, and marched against\n\u2018Alexander. When he found a place where he saw there was no clay, but that on account of\nthe sand the ground was all level and hard, and thus fit forthe advance and retreat of horses,\nhe there drew up his army. First he placed the elephants in the front, each animal being not\nless than a plethrum'\u201d apart, so that they might be extended in the front before the whole of\nthe phalans of infantry, and produce terror everywhere among Alexander's cavalry. Besides\nhe thought that none of the enemy would have the audacity to push themselves into the\nspaces between the elephants, the cavalry being deterred by the fright oftheir horses; and\nstill less would the infantry do so, it being likely they would be kept off in front by the\nhheavy-armed soldiers falling upon them, and trampled down by the elephants wheeling\nround against them. Near these he had posted the infantry, not oceupying a line on a level\nWith the beasts, but in a second line behind them, only so far distant that the companies of\nfoot might be pushed forward a short distance into the spaces between them. He had also\nbodies of infantry standing beyond the elephants on the wings; and on both sides of the\ninfantry he had posted the cavalry, infront of which were placed the chariots on both wings\n\u2018of his army.\n"

The head of an ox had been engraved upon him as a\ndistinguishing mark, and aecording to some this was the reason why he bore that name; but 2\n\u2018others say, that though he was black he had a white mark upon his head which bore a great\nresemblance to the head of an ox. In the land of the Uxians this horse vanished from\n\u2018Alexander, who thereupon sent a proclamation throughout the country that he would kil all\n\u2018the inhabitants, unless they brought the horse back to him. As a result of this proclamation it\n\u2018was immediately brought back. So great was Alexander's attachment to the horse, and so\n\u2018reat was the fear of Alexander entertained by the barbarians.\" Let so much honour be\npaid by me to this Bucephalas forthe sake of his master.\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nConquest oF THE GLAUSIANS.\u2014EMMASSY FROM AMISARES.\u2014PASSAGE OF THE ACESINES,\nWaren Alexander had paid all due honours to those who had been killed in the battle, he\noffered the customary sacrifices to the gods in gratitude for his victory, and celebrated a\n"

For a short time before it happened\nthat Porus and Abisares had marched against them with their own forces and had roused\nmany other tribes of the independent Indians to arms, but were forced to retreat without\neffecting anything worthy of the preparations they had made. When Alexander was\ninformed of this, he made a forced march against the Cathaeans, and on the second day after\nstarting from the river Hydraotes he arrived ata city called Pimprama, inhabited by a tribe\nof Indians named Adraistaeans, who yielded to him on terms of capitulation.

The Macedonians without difficulty forced the Indians from the first\nrow of waggons; but then the Indians, taking their stand infront of the second row, more\neasily repulsed the attack, because they were posted in denser array in a smaller circle.\nMoreover the Macedonians were attacking them likewise in a confined space, while the\nIndians were secretly ereeping under the front row of waggons, and without regard to\ndiscipline were assaulting their enemy through the gaps left between the waggons as each\nman found a chance.\" But nevertheless even from these the Indians were forebly driven\nby the phalanx of infantry. They no longer made a stand atthe third row, but fled as fast as\npossible into the city and shut themselves up in it. During that day Alexander with his\ninfantry encamped round the ety, as much of i, atleast, as his phalanx could surround; for\nhhe could not with his camp completely encircle the wal, so extensive was it. Opposite the\npart unenelosed by his camp, near which also was a lake, he posted the cavalry, placing\n\u2018them all round the lake, which he discovered to be shallow. Moreover, he conjectured that\nthe Indians, being terrified at their previous defeat, would abandon the city in the night; and\nit tumed out just as he had conjectured; for about the second watch of the night most of\n\u2018them dropped down from the wall, but fell in with\u201d the sentinels of eavalry. The foremost\n\u2018of them were cut to pieces by these; but the men behind them perceiving that the lake was\n\u2018guarded all round, withdrew into the city again. Alexander now surrounded the city with a\ndouble stockade, except in the part where the lake shut it in, and round the lake he posted\nmore perfect guards. He also resolved to bring military engines up 0 the wall, to batter it\ndown. But some of the men in the city deserted to him, and told him that the Indians\nintended that very night to steal out ofthe city and escape by the lake, where the gap in the\nstockade existed. He accordingly stationed Prolemy, son of Lagus, there, giving him three\nregiments ofthe shield-bearing guards, all the Agrianians, and one line of archers, pointing\n\u2018out to him the place where he especially conjectured the barbarians would try to force their\n\u2018way. \u201cWhen thou pereeivest the barbarians foreing their way here,\u201d said he, \u201cdo thou, with\nthe army obstruct their advance, and order the bugler to give the signal.

But, O Macedonians and Grecian\nallies, stand firm! Glorious are the deeds of those who undergo labour and run the risk of\ndanger; and it is delightful to live a life of valour and to die leaving behind immortal glory.\nDo ye not know that our ancestor\u201d reached so great a height of glory as from being a man\nto become a god, or to seem to become one, not by remaining in Tiryns or Atgos, or even\ninthe Peloponnese or at Thebes? The labours of Dionysus were not few, and he Was too\nexalted a deity to be compared with Heracles. But we, indeed, have penetrated into regions\n\u2018beyond Nysa'\"\u201d; and the rock of Aornus, which Heracles was unable to capture, is in our\npossession. Do ye also add the parts of Asia still left unsubdued to those already acquired,\nthe few to the many. But what great or glorious deed could we have performed, if, siting at\ncease in Macedonia, we had thought it sufficient to preserve our own country without any\nlabour, simply repelling the attacks of the nations on our frontiers, the Thracians, Ilyrians,\n"

Hereupon, he repeatedly urged\nany one who wished it, to speak, if he entertained different views from those which he had\nhimself expressed. Nevertheless the silence still continued a long time; but at last, Coenus,\nson of Polemocrates, plucked up courage and spoke as follows\"\u201d:\u2014\"O king, inasmuch as\nthou dost not wish to rule Macedonians by compulsion, but sayest thou will lead them by\npersuasion, or yielding to their persuasion wilt not use violence towards them, Iam going to\nmake a speech, not on my on behalf and that of my colleagues here present, who are held\nin greater honour than the other soldiers, and most of us have already carried off the rewards\n\u2018of our labours, and from our preeminence are more zealous than the rest to serve thee in all\n\u2018things; but I am going to speak on behalf ofthe bulk of the army. On behalf of this army 1\nam not going to say what may be gratifying to the men, but what I consider to be both\nadvantageous to thee at present, and safest forthe future. I fee it incumbent upon me not to\n\u2018conceal what I think the best course to pursue, both on account of my age, the honour paid\nto me by the rest of the army at thy behest, and the boldness which I have without any\nhesitation displayed up to the present time in incurring dangers and undergoing labours. The\nmore numerous and the greater the exploits have been, which were achieved by thee as our\n\u2018commander, and by those who started from home with thee, the more advantageous does it\nseem fo me that some end should be put to out labours and dangers. For thou thyself seest\nhhow many Macedonians and Greeks started with thee, and how few of us have been left. OF\n\u2018our number thou didst well in sending back home the Thessalians at once from Bactra,\nbecause thou didst perceive that they were no longer eager to undergo labours.\u201d OF the\nother Greeks, some have been settled as colonists in the cities which thou hast founded;\nwhere they remain not indeed all of them of their own fee will. The Macedonian soldiers\nand the other Greeks who still continued to share our labours and dangers, have either\nperished in the battles, become unfit for war on account of their wounds, or been left behind\nin the different parts of Asia. The majority, however, have perished from disease, so that few\nare left out of many; and these few are no longer equally vigorous in body, while in spitt\nthey are much more exhausted. All those whose parents still survive, feel a great yearning to\nsee them once more; they feel a yearning after their wives and children, and a yearning for\ntheir native land itself; which itis surely pardonable for them to yearn to see again with the\nhhonour and dignity they have acquired from thee, returning as great men, whereas they\ndeparted small, and as rich men instead of being poor.

These people, indeed, had\nresolved to join their forces with the Oxyedracians and then to make a desperate struggle: but\nhh forestaled them by marching against them through the waterless county, before any aid\ncould reach them fom the Oxydracians, or they could render any help to the latter\nMoreover, the common account is, thatthe last battle fought with Darius was near Arbea, at\nWhich bat he fled and did not desist from flight until he was arrested by Bessus and pul to\ndeath at Alexander's approach; just as the battle before this was at Isus, and the frst\n\u2018cavalry batle near the Granicus. The cavalry battle did really take place near the Granicus,\nandthe next battle with Darius near Issus; but those authors who make Abela most distant\nsay that itis 600\u00b0 stades distant from the place where the last batle between Alexander\nand Datius was fought, while those who make it least distant, say that itis 500 stades off.\nMoreover, Ptolemy and Acistobulus say thatthe bate was fought at Gaugamela near the\nriver Bumodus. But as Gaugamela was not a city, but only a large village, the place is not\ncelebrated, nor is the name pleasing tothe eat; hence, it seems to me, that Abel, being a\n\u2018ity, has caried off the glory of the great battle. But if is necessary to consider that this\nengagement took place near Arbela, being in reality so far distant feom it, then itis\nallowable to say thatthe sea-batle fought at Salamis occurred neat the isthmus\u201d of the\nCorinthians, and that fought at Artemisium, in Euboea, oecurted neae Aegina or Sunium,\nMoreover, in regard to those who covered Aiexander with thie shields i his peril all agree\nthat Peucestas di so; but they no longer agree in regard to Leonnatus of Abreas, the Soldier\nin receipt of double pay for his distinguished services.

Nearchus alone asserts that Alexander pursued\nthis route, not from ignorance of the difficulty of the journey, but because he heard that no\n\u2018one had ever hitherto passed that way with an army an emerged in safety from the desert,\n\u2018except Semiramis, when she fled from India.

They were far on the journey, and Alexander\nhimself, though oppressed with thirst, was nevertheless with great pain and difficulty\nleading the army on foot, so that his soldiers, a i usual in such a case, might more patiently\n\u2018bear their hardships by the equalization ofthe distress. At this time some of the light-armed\nsoldiers, starting away from the army in quest of water, found some collected in a shallow\nclef, a small and mean spring. Collecting this water with difficulty, they came with all\nspeed to Alexander, as if they were bringing him some great boon. AS soon as they\napproached the king, they poured the water into a helmet and carried it to him. He took it,\nand commending the men who brought it, immediately poured it upon the ground in the\nsight ofall. Asa result of this action, the entire army was re-invigorated to so great a degree\nthat any one would have imagined thatthe water poured away by Alexander had farmished a\ndraught to every man. This deed beyond all others I commend as evidence of Alexander's,\npower of endurance and selfcontol, as well as of his skill in managing an army. The\nfollowing adventure also occurred to the army in that country. At last the guides declared\nthat they no longer remembered the way, because the tracks of it had been rendered invisible\nby the wind blowing the sand over them. Moreover, in the deep sand which had been\n\u2018everywhere reduced fo one level, there was nothing by which they could conjecture the right\nway, not even the usual trees growing along it, nor any solid hillock rising up: and they had\nnot practised themselves in making journeys by the stars at night or by the sun in the\ndaytime, as sailors do by the constellations ofthe Bears\u2014the Phoenicians by the Litle Bear,\nand other men by the Greater Bear\u201d Then at length Alexander perceived that it was\nnecessary for him to lead the way by declining to the let; and taking a few horsemen with\nhim he advanced in front ofthe army.

He deposed\nApollophanes from the viceroyaly,\" because he discovered that he had paid no heed to his,\ninstructions. Thoas was appointed vieeroy over the people ofthis district; but as he fel ill\nand died, ibyrtius sueceeded to the office. The same man had also lately been appointed by\n\u2018Alexander viceroy of Carmania; but now the rule over the Arachotians and Gadtosians was\ntgiven 10 him, and Tlepolemus, son of Pythophanes, received Carmania. The king was\nalready advancing into Carmania, when news was brought to him that Philip, the viceroy of\nthe country of the Indians, had been ploted against by the mercenaries and treacherously\nKilled; but that Philip\u2019s Macedonian body-guards had caught some of the murderers in the\nvery act and others afterwards, and had put them to death. When be had ascertained this, he\nsent a letter into India to Eudemus and Taxiles, ordering them to administer the affairs ofthe 3\nland which had previously been subordinated to Philip until he could send a viceroy for it\nWhen he arrived in Carmania, Craters effected a junction with him, bringing with him the\nrest of the army and the elephants. He also brought Ordanes, whom he had arrested for\nrevolting and tying to effect a revolution *\u2122 Thither also came Stasanor, the viceroy of the\nAreians'\"* and Zarangians, accompanied by Pharismanes, son of Phrataphernes, the viceroy\n\u2018of the Parthians and Hyrcanians. There came also the generals who had been left with\nParmenio over the army in Media, Cleander, Sitalees, and Heracon, bringing with them the\n\u2018greater part of their army. Both\u2019the natives and the soldiers themselves brought many\naccusations against Cleander and Sitalces, as for example, that the temples had been\npillaged by them, old tombs rifled, and other acts of injustice, recklessness, and tyranny\nperpetrated against their subjects. As these charges were proved,\u201d he put them to death, in\n\u2018order to inspire others who might be left as vieeroys, governors, or prefeets of provinces\nwiththe fear of suffering equal penalties with them if they swerved from the path of duty.\u201d\nThis was one of the chief means by which Alexander kept in subordination the nations\nwhich he had conquered in war or which had voluntarily submitted to him, though they\n\u2018were so many in number and so far distant from each other: because under his regal sway it\n\u2018was not allowed that those who were ruled should be unjustly treated by those who ruled. At_ 3\nthat time Heracon was aequtted ofthe charge, but soon after, being convicted by the men of\nSusa of having pillaged the temple in that city, he also suffered punishment. Stasanor and\nPhrataphernes came to Alexander bringing a multitude of beasts of burden and many\ncamels, when they learnt that he was marching by the route to Gadrosia, conjecturing that\nhis army would suffer the very hardships which it did sufer. Therefore these men arrived\njust at the very time they were required, as also did their camels and beasts of burden. For\n\u2018Alexander distributed all these animals to the officers man by man, to all the various\nsquadrons and centuries of the cavalry, and tothe various companies of the infantry, as their.\n\u2018number allowed him.\n"

In Carmania Alexander offered sacrifices to the gods as thank-\nofferings for his victory over the Indians, and because his army had been brought in safety\n\u2018out of Gadrosia, He also celebrated a musical and gymnastic contest. He then appointed\nPeucestas one of his confidential body-guards, having already resolved to make him Viceroy\nof Persis. He wished him, before being appointed to the viceroyalty, to experience this\nhonour and evidence of confidence, asa reward for his exploit among the Mallians.

Peueestas, who had held the shield over\n\u2018Alexander, was now added to them as an eighth. At this time Nearchus, having sailed round\n\u2018the coast of Ora and Gadrosia and that of the Fehthyophagi put into port in the inhabited\npart ofthe coastland of Carmania,*\u2019 and going up thence into the interior with a few men\nhie reported to Alexander the particulars of the voyage which he had made along the coasts\n\u2018of the extemal sea, Nearchus Was then sent down to the sea again to sail round as far as the\ncountry of Susiana, and the outlets ofthe river Tiges.*\"! How he sailed from the river Indus *\nto the Persian Sea and the mouth ofthe Tigres, I shall describe in a separate book, following\nthe account of Nearchus himself For he also wrote a history of Alexander in Greek\nPerhaps I shall be able to compose this narrative in the future, if inclination and the divine\ninfluence urge me to it. Alexander now ordered Hephaestion to march into Perss from\n\u2018Carmania along the seashore with the larger division of the army and the beasts of burden,\ntaking with him also the elephants; because, as he was making the expedition inthe season\n\u2018of winter\" the part of Persis near the sea was warm and possessed abundant supplies of\nprovisions\n\nCHAPTER XXIX,\n"

The tomb of the famous\n\u2018Cyrus was in the royal park at Pasargadae, and around it a grove of all kinds of tees had\n\u2018been planted. It was also watered by a stream, and high grass grew in the meadow: The base\n\u2018of the tomb itself had been made of squared stone in the form of a rectangle. Above there\nwas a stone building surmounted by a roof, with a door leading within, so narrow that even\n\u2018small man could with difficulty enter, after suffering much discomfort\" In the building\nlay a golden coffin, in which the body of Cyrus had been buried, and by the side of the\ncoffin was a couch, the feet of which were of gold wrought with the hammer. A carpet of\nBabylonian tapestry with purple rugs formed the bedding: upon it were also a Median coat\nWith sleeves and other tunics of Babylonian manufacture. Aristobulus adds that Median\n\u2018rousers and robes dyed the colour of hyacinth were also lying upon it as well as others of 3\n\u2018purple and various other colours; moreover there were collars, sabres, and earrings of gold\nand precious stones soldered together, and near them stood a table. On the middle of the\ncouch lay the coffin which contained the body of Cyrus. Within the enclosure, near the\nascent leading to the tomb, there was a small house built for the Magians who guarded the\ntomb; a duty which they had discharged ever since the time of Cambyses, son of Cyrus, son\nsucceeding father as guard. To these men a sheep and specified quantities of wheaten flour\nand wine were given daily by the king; and a horse once a month as a sactifice to Cyrus.\nUpon the tomb an inscription in Persian letters had been placed, which bore the following\nmeaning in the Persian language: \u201cO man, 1am Cyrus, son of Cambyses, who founded the\nempire ofthe Persians, and was king of Asia. Do not therefore grudge me this monument.\u201d\n\u2018As soon as Alexander had conquered Persia, he was very desirous of entering the tomb of\n\u2018Cynus; but he found that everything else had been carried off except the coflin and couch,\n\u2018They had even maltreated the king's body: for they had tora off the lid of the coffin and east\n\u2018out the eorpse. They had tried to make the coffin itself of smaller bulk and thus more\nportable, by cutting part of it off and crushing part of it up; but as their efforts did not\nsucceed, they departed, leaving the coffin in that state. Aristobulus says that he was himself\ncommissioned by Alexander to restore the tomb for Cyrus, to put in the coffin the parts of\nthe body still preserved, to put the lid on, and to restore the parts of the coffin which had\nbeen defaced. Moreover he was instructed to stretch the couch tight with bands, and to\ndeposit all the other things which used to lie there for ornament, both resembling the former 3\n\u2018ones and of the same number. He was ordered also to do away with the door, building part\n\u2018of itup with stone and plastering part of it over with cement; and finally to put the royal sea\nupon the cement. Alexander arrested the Magians who were the guards of the tomb, and put\n\u2018them to the torture to make them confess who had done the deed; but in spite ofthe torture\nthey confessed nothing either about themselves or any other person.

Aftica), and Numidia beyond Mount Atlas\nto Gadeira (ie. Cadiz)\u201d inward into our sea (i.e. the Mediterranean); thinking that after he 3%\nhhad subdued both Libya and Carchedon (ie. Carthage), he might with justice be ealled king\n\u2018of all Asia For he sad thatthe kings ofthe Persians and Medes called themselves Great\nKings without any right, sine they did not rule the larger par of Asia Some say that he was\nmeditating a voyage thence into the Euxine Sea, to Seythia and the Lake Maeotis (i.e. the\nSea of Azov); while others assert that he intended to go to Sicily and the lapygian Cape,\u201d\nfor the fame of the Romans spreading far and wide was now exciting his jealousy. For my\n\u2018own part I cannot conjecture with any certainty what were his plans; and T do not eae to\n\u2018guess. But this | think T ean confidently affirm, that he meditated nothing small or mean;\nand that he would never have remained satisfied with any of the acquisitions he had made,\neven if he had added Europe to Asia, or the islands ofthe Britons to Europe; but would still\nhave gone on seeking for unknown lands beyond those mentioned. I verily believe that if he\nhhad found no one else to strive with, he would have striven with himself. And on this\naccount commend some ofthe Indian philosophers, who are said to have been caught by\n\u2018Alexander as they were walking in the open meadow where they were accustomed to spend\n\u2018their time.\u201d At the sight of him and his army they did nothing else but stamp with their feet\n\u2018on the earth, upon which they were stepping. When he asked them by means of interpreters\n\u2018what was the meaning of their action, they replied as follows: \u201cO king Alexander, every\nman possesses as much of the earth as this upon which we have stepped; but thou being\n\u2018only a man like the rest of us, except in being meddlesome and arrogant, art come over so\n\u2018reat a part of the earth from thy own land, giving trouble both to thyself and others\"!

To Craterus he gave Amastrine, daughter of Oxyartes the brother of\nDarius; to Perdiccas, the daughter of Atropates, viceroy of Media; to Ptolemy the\nconfidential body-guard, and Eumenes the royal secretary, the daughters of Artabazus, tothe\nformer Artacama, and to the latter Artonis. To Nearchus he gave the daughter of Barsine and\nMentor, to Seleucus the daughter of Spitamenes the Bactrian. Likewise to the rest of his\n\u2018Companions he gave the choicest daughters of the Persians and Medes, to the number of\neighty. The weddings were celebrated after the Persian manner, seats being placed in a row\nfor the bridegrooms; and after the banguet the brides came in and seated themselves, each 3\n\u2018one near her own inisband. The bridegroom took them by the right hand and kissed them;\nthe king being the firs to begin, for the weddings of all were conducted in the same way\nThis appeared the most popula thing which Alexander ever did; and it proved his affection\nfor his Companions. Each man took his own bride and led her away; and on all without\nexception Alexander bestowed dowries.\u2122* He also ordered thatthe names of all the other\nMacedonians who had married any of the Asiatic women should be registered. They were\n\u2018over 10,000 in number, and to these Alexander made presents on account of their weddings.\n"

The rest of the ships were conveyed down the Eulaeus as far as the canal which has\nbeen cut from the Tigres into the Eulacus, and by this means they were brought into the\nTigres. Of the rivers Fuphates and Tigres which enclose Syria between them, whence also\nits name is called by the natives Mesopotamia, the Tigres flows in a much lower channel\n\u2018than the Euphrates, from which it receives many canals; and afte taking up many tributaries\nand its waters being swelled by them, it falls into the Persian Sea.\" It is a large river and\n\u00abean be erossed on foot nowhere as far as its mouth,\" inasmuch as none of its water is used\nup by irigation of the country. For the land through which it flows is more elevated than its\nwater, and itis not drawn off into canals or into another river, but rather receives them into\nitself. It is nowhere possible to irrigate the land from it. But the Euphrates flows in an\nelevated channel, and is everywhere on a level with the land through which it passes. Many\nceanals have been made from it, some of which are always kept flowing, and from which the\ninhabitants on both banks supply themselves with water; others the people make only when\nrequisite to irrigate the land, when they are in need of water from drought. For this\ncountry is usually fre from rain. The consequence i, that the Euphrates at lst has only a\nsmall Volume of water, which disappears into a marsh. Alexander sailed over the sea round\nthe shore of the Persian Gulf lying between the rivers Eulaeus and Tigres: and thence he\nsailed up the latter river as far as the camp where Hephaestion had settled with all his forces.\n\u2018Thence he sailed again to Opis, a city situated on that river In his voyage up he destroyed\nthe weirs which existed in the river, and thus made the stream quite level. These weirs had\n\u2018been constructed by the Persians, 10 prevent any enemy having a superior naval force from\nsailing up from the sea into their country. The Persians had had recourse to these\ncontrivances because they were not a nautical people; and thus by making an unbroken\nsuccession of weits they had rendered the voyage up the Tigres a matter of impossibility\nBut Alexander said that such devices were unbecoming to men who are victorious in battle;\nand therefore he considered this means of safety unsuitable for him; and by easly\ndemolishing the laborious work of the Persians, he proved in fact that what they thought a\nprotection was unworthy ofthe name.\n"

To these\n\u2018Alexander gave the pay not only forthe time which had already elapsed, but also for that\nWhich they would spend in returning home. He also gave to each man a talent in addition to\nhis pay. If any of them had children by Asiatic wives, he ordered them to leave them\n\u2018behind with him, lest they should introduce into Macedonia a cause of discord, taking with\nthem children by foreign women who were ofa different race from the children whom they\nhhad left behind at home born of Macedonian mothers. He promised to take care that they\nshould be brought up as Macedonians, educating them not only in general matters but also\nin the art of war. He also undertook to lead them into Macedonia when they arrived at\nmanhood, and hand them over to thei fathers. These uncertain and obscure promises were\nmade to them as they were departing: and he thought he was giving a most indubitable proof\nof the friendship and affection he had for them by sending with them, as theie guardian and\nthe leader of the expedition, Craterus, the man most faithful to him, and whom he valued\nequally with himself Then, having saluted them all, he with tears dismissed them\nlikewise weeping from his presence. He ordered Craterus\u00ae to lead these men back, and\nWhen he had done so, 0 take upon himself the government of Macedonia, Thrace, and\n\u2018Thessaly, and to preside over the freedom of the Greeks. He also ordered Antipater to bring\nto him the Macedonians of manly age as successors to those who were being sent back. He\ndespatched Polysperchon also with Craterus, as his second in command, so that if any\nmishap befell Craterus on the march (For he was sending him back on\u2019 account of the\nweakness of his health), those who were going might not be in need of a general.\u2122' A seeret\nreport was also going about that Alexander was now overcome by his mother's accusations\n\u2018of Antipater, and that he wished to remove him from Macedonia.\" This report was eurrent\namong those who thought that royal aetions are more worthy of honour in proportion to\ntheir secrecy, and who were inclined to impute what is worthy of belief to a bad motive\nrather than to attribute ito the real one: a course to which they were led by appearances and. 3\ntheir own depravity. But probably this sending for Antipater was not designed for his\ndishonour, but rather to prevent any unpleasant consequences to Antipater and Olympias\nfrom their quarrel which he might not himself be able to rectify. For they were incessantly\n\\riting to Alexander, the former saying that the arrogance, acerbity, and meddlesomeness of\n\u2018Olympias was exceedingly unbecoming to the king's mother; insomuch that Alexander was\nrelated to have used the following remark in reference to the reports which he received\nabout his mother:\u2014that she was exacting fiom him a heavy house-rent for the ten\nmonths.\u00ae The queen wrote that Antipater was overweeningly insolent in his pretensions\nand in the service of his cour, no longer remembering the one who had appointed him, but\nclaiming to win and hold the frst rank**\u201d among the Macedonians and Greeks.

Herodotus\nsays that the plain itself was named Nisaean, and that the mares were called Nisaean\"\u201d;\nadding that in olden times there were 150,000 of these horses. But at ths time Alexander\nfound not many above 50,000; for most of them had been carried off by robbers. They say\nthat Atropates, the viceroy of Media, gave him a hundred women, saying that they were of\nthe race of Amazons\u201d? These had been equipped with the arms of male horsemen, except\nthat they carried axes instead of spears and targets instead of shields. They also say that they\nhhad the right breast smaller than the left, and that they exposed it in battle. Alexander\ndismissed them from the army, that no attempt to violate them might be made by the\nMacedonians or barbarians; and he ordered them to carry word to their queen that he was. 3\ncoming to her in order to procreate children by het.\u201d But this story has been recorded\nneither by Aristobulus nor Ptolemy, nor any other writer who is @ tustworthy authority on\nsuch matters. Ido not even think thatthe race of Amazons was surviving at that time: for\nbefore Alexander's time they were not mentioned even by Xenophon,\u201d who mentions the\nPhasians, Colehians, and all the other barbaric raees which the Greeks came upon, when\nthey started from Trapezus or before they marched down to Trapezus. They would certainly\nhave fallen in with the Amazons if they were sill in existence. However it does not seem to\nme eredible that this race of women was altogether fictitious, because it has been celebrated\nbby so many famous poets. For the general account i, that Heracles marched against them\nand brought the girdle of their queen Hippolyte into Greece.\u2122* The Athenians also under\n\u2018Theseus were the first to conquer and repulse these women as they were advancing into\nEurope\"; and the battle of the Athenians and Amazons has been painted by Micon,\u201d\u201d\u201d no\nless than that of the Athenians and Persians. Herodotus also has frequently written about\nthese women'\u00ae*; and so have the Athenian writers who have honoured the men who\nperished in war with funeral orations. They have mentioned the exploit of the Athenians\nagainst the Amazons as one of their special glories.\"\u201d If therefore Atropates showed any\n\u2018equestrian women to Alexander, think he must have shown him some other foreign women\ntrained in horsemanship, and equipped with the arms which were said to be those of the\nAmazons.\u201d\nCHAPTER XIV.\n"

He also resolved to celebrate a gymnastic and musical contest, much\nmore magnificent than any of the preceding, both in the multitude of competitors and in the\namount of money expended upon it.

Afier the enemy\u2019s departure, they used to turn themselves\nagain to marauding, by which occupation they supported themselves. But Alexander\nsubdued this race, though he marched against them in the winter; for neither winter nor\nruggedness of ground was any impediment either to him or to Ptolemy, son of Lagus, who\nled a part of the army in the campaign against them. Thus no military enterprise which\n\u2018Alexander undertook was ever unsuccessful. As he was marching back to Babylon, he was\nmet by embassies from the Libyans, who congratulated him and crowned him as conqueror\nof the kingdom of Asia.\" From Italy also came Bruttians, Lucanians, and Tyethenians\u201d\u201d as\nenvoys, forthe same purpose.

Apotlodorus the Amphipolitan, one\nof Alexander's Companions, was general ofthe army which the king left with Mazaeus, the\nViceroy of Babylon.\u201d\u201d\u201d When he joined his forees with the king\u2019s on the return of the later\nfrom India, and observed that he was severely punishing the viceroys who had been placed\n\u2018over the several countries, he sent to his brother Peithagoras and asked him to divine about\nhis safety. For Peithagoras was a diviner who derived his knowledge of the future from the\ninspection of the inward parts of animals. This man sent back to Apollodorus, inquiring of\nwhom he was so especialy afraid, as to wish to consult divination, The ltter wrote back:\n\u201cThe_king himself and Hephaestion.\u201d Peithagoras therefore in the first place offered\nsacrifice with reference to Hephaestion. But as there was no lobe visible upon the iver of\n\u2018the sacrificial victim,\" he stated tis fact ina letter, which he sealed and sent to is brother\nfrom Babylon to Ecbatana, explaining that there was no reason at all to be afiaid of\nHeephaestion, for in a short time he would be out of their way. And Aristobulus says that\nApollodorus received this epistle only one day before Hephaestion died. Then Peithagoras\n\u2018again offered sacrifice in respect to Alexander, and the liver of the vietim consulted in\nrespect to him was also destitute of a lobe. He therefore wrote to Apollodorus to the same\n\u2018purport about Alexander as about Hephaestion. Apollodorus did not conceal the information\nSent to him, but told Alexander, in order the more to show his good-will to the king, if he\nurged him to be on his guard lest some danger might befall him at that time. And\nAristobulus says thatthe king commended Apollodorus, and when he entered Babylon, he\nasked Peithagoras what sign he had met with, o induce him to write thus to his brother: He\nsaid that the liver of the victim sacrificed for him was without a lobe. When Alexander\nasked what the sign portended, he said that it was a very disastrous one. The king was so far\nfrom being angry with him, that he even treated him with greater respect, fr telling him the\n\u2018ruth without any disguise. Aristobulus says that he himself heard this story from\nPeithagoras; and adds that the same man acted as diviner for Perdiceas and afterwards for\n\u2018Antigonus, and that the same sign occurred for both. It was verified by fact; for Perdiccas\nlost his life leading an army against Ptolemy.\u201d and Antigonus was killed in the batle\nfought by him at Ipsus against Seleucus and Lysimachus.\u201d Also concerning Calanus, the\nIndian philosopher, the following story has been recorded. When he was going tothe funeral\npyte to die, he gave the parting salutation to all his other companions; but he refused to\napproach Alexander to give him the salutation, saying he would meet him at Babylon and 4\nthere salute him. At the time indeed this remark was treated with neglect; but afterwards,\nWhen Alexander had died at Babylon, it came to the recollection of those who had head it,\nand they thought forsooth that it was a divine intimation of Alexander's approaching end.\nCHAPTER XIX.\n"

The other island was said to be distant from the\nmouth ofthe Euphrates about a day and night\u2019s voyage fora ship running before the breeze.\nTis name was Tylus\u201d; it was large and most of it nether rugged nor woody, but suitable for\nproducing cultivated fruits and all things in due season. Some of this information was\nimparted to Alexander by Archias, who Was sent with a triacontor to investigate the course\nof the coasting voyage to Arabia, and who went as far as the island of Tylus, but durst not\n\u2018pass beyond that point.

Nearchus indeed\nin his voyage from India had seen this stretching out alittle, before he turned aside into the\nPersian Gulf, and he was almost induced to cross over to it. The pilot Onesicrtus thought\n\u2018they ought to have gone thither; but Nearchus says that he himself prevented it, so that after\nsailing Fight round the Persian Gulf he might be able o give a report to Alexander that he\nhhad accomplished the voyage on which he had sent him. For Nearchus said he had not been\ndespatched to navigate the Great Sea, but to explore the land bordering on the sea, to find\n\u2018out what men inhabit it, to discover the harbours and rivers in it, to ascertain the eustoms of\nthe people, and to see if any of the country was fertile and if any was sterile. This was the\nreason why Alexander's naval expedition returned in safety; for if it had sailed beyond the\ndeserts of Arabia, it would not have returned in safety.

The following story is told. Most of the\ntombs of the Assyrian kings had been built among the pools and marshes.*! When\n\u2018Alexander was sailing through these marshes, and, as the story goes, was himself steering\nthe treme, a strong gust of wind fell upon his broad-brimmed Macedonian hat, and the\nfillet which encircled it. The hat, being heavy, fell into the water; but the fillet, being carried\nalong by the wind, was caught by one of the reeds growing near the tomb of one of the\nancient kings.\" This incident itself was an omen of what was about to occur, and so was\n\u2018the fact that one of the sailors\u201d* swam off towards the fillet and snatched it fom the reed,\nBut he did not carry it in his hands, because it would have been wetted while he was\nswimming: he therefore put it round his own head and thus conveyed it tothe king. Most of\nthe biographers of Alexander say thatthe king presented him with a talent as a reward for 4\nhis zeal, and then ordered his head to be eut off: as the prophets had directed him not to\npermit that head to be safe which had worn the royal fillet. However, Aristobulus says that\nthe man received a talent; but afterwards also received a scourging for placing the fillet\nround his head. The same author says that it was one of the Phoenician sailors who fetched\nthe fillet for Alexander; but there are some who say it was Seleucus, and that this was an\n\u2018omen to Alexander of his death and to Seleucus of his great kingdom. For that of all those\n\u2018who succeeded to the sovereignty after Alexander, Seleueus became the greatest king, was\n\u2018the most kingly in mind, and ruled over the greatest extent of land after Alexander himself,\ndoes not seem to me to admit of question.\u201d\n"

When he had advanced about thirty stades, the earth appeared to be somewhat\nrocky, $0 that if it were cut through and a junction made with the old canal along the\nPallacopas, on account ofthe hardness of the soil, it would not allow the water to percolate,\nand there Would be no difficulty in turning it back atthe appointed season. For this purpose\nhe sailed to the Pallacopas, and then continued his voyage down that canal into the pools\ntowards the country of the Arabs. There seeing a certain admirable site, he founded a city\nupon it and fortified it In it he settled as many of the Grecian mercenaries as volunteered to\nremain, and such as were unfit for military service by reason of age or wounds.\n"

Philoxenus also came to\nhim, bringing an army from Caria; Menander, with another feom Lydia, and Menidas with\nthe cavalry which had been put under his command. * At the same time arrived embassies\nfrom Greece, the members of which, with crowns upon their own heads, approached\n\u2018Alexander and erowned him with golden crowns, a if forsooth they came to him as special\n\u2018envoys deputed to pay him divine honours; and his end was not far of. Then he commended 4\nthe Persians for their great zeal towards him, which was shown by their obedience to\nPeucestas in all things, and Peucestas himself forthe prudence which he had displayed in\nruling them. He distributed these foreign soldiers among the Macedonian ranks in the\nfollowing way. Each company was led by a Macedonian decurion, and next to him was a\nMacedonian receiving double pay for distinguished valour; and then came one who received\nten states,\u201d who was so named from the pay he received, being less than that received by\n\u2018the man with double pay, but more than that of the men who were serving as soldiers\nWithout holding a position of honour. Next to these came twelve Persians, and last in the\ncompany another Macedonian, who also received the pay of ten staters; so that in each\n\u2018company there were twelve Persians and four Macedonians, three of whom received higher\npay, and the fourth was in command of the company.\u201d*\u201d The Macedonians were armed in\ntheir hereditary manner; but of the Persians some were archers, while others had javelins\nfurnished with straps, by which they were held\" At this time Alexander often reviewed his\nfleet, had many sham-fights with his tiremes and quadriremes in the river, and contests\nboth for rowers and pilots, the winners receiving crowns.\n\n\u2018Now arrived the special envoys whom he had despatched to Ammon to inquire how it\nas lal for him to honour Hephaestion. They told him that Ammon said it was lal to\noffer sacrifice to him as to hero. Rejoicing atthe response of the oracle, he paid respect to\nhhim as a hero ftom that time. He also despatched a letter to Cleomenes, who was a bad man\nand had committed many acts of injustice in Egypt.\u201d For my own part Ido not blame him\nfor his friendship to Hephaestion and for his recollection of him even when dead: but I do\nblame him for many other acts. For the letter commanded Cleomenes to prepare chapels for\nthe hero Hephaestion in the Egyptian Alexandeia, one in the city itself and another in the\nisland of Pharos, where the tower is situated The chapels were to be exceedingly large\nand to be built at lavish expense. The letter also directed that Cleomenes should take care\nthat Hephaestion\u2019s name should be attached to them; and moreover that his name should be\nengraved on all the legal documents with which the merchants entered into bargains with\ncach other.\" These things [cannot blame, except that he made so much ado about matters\nof trifling moment. But the following I must blame severely: \u201cIf I find,\u201d said the letter, \u201cthe\ntemples and chapels of the hero Hephaestion in Egypt well completed, I will not only\npardon you any erimes you may have committed in the past, but in the future you shall\nsuffer no unpleasant treatment from me, however great may be the erimes you have\ncommitted.\u201d I cannot commend this message sent from a great king to a man who was\nruling a large country and many people, especially as the man was a wieked one.\"\n\ni\nCHAPTER XXIV,\nANoritER Owen oF ALEXANDER\u2019S DEATH,\nBur Alexander\u2019s own end was now near.

See Smith's Dictionary of Antiguits.\n\n1g Alexander the Great was the son of Philp IL and Olympias, and was boen at Pella\n1c. 386. In his youth he was placed under the ition of Aristotle, who acquired very great\ninfluence over his mind and characte, and retained it until his pupil was spoiled by his\nunparalleled successes.

The fact thatthe Philistines came parly feom Crete is also affirmed in Amos\nix 7. Another branch of the Philistines came fiom Casloach in Egypt.

It was\ngoverned by its own kings under the Babylonian and Persian empires; and under the later\nPower it reached its highest prosperity, surpassing Tyre in wealth and importance. In the\nExpedition of Xerxes against Greece, the Sidonians furnished the best ships in the whole\nAce, and their king obtained the highest place under Xerxes in the council. But they\nrevolted against Ochus, king of Persia and being betrayed to him by their own king Tennes,\n\u2018hey burt thee city and ships. I is sid that 40,000 persons perished in the fire and by the\nsword, mc. 381. (Diodorus, xvi. 43-45). No doubt this barbarous treatment of Ochus\ninduced the Sidonians to take the side of Alexander.

Valuable information about the power, tade, and customs of Tyre is\nderived from Ezek. xxvi-cevil; and we lear the fact that she employed mercenaries like\nher colony Carthage (Ezek. xxvii. 10, 11)-In the classical writers the name is corrupted into\n\u2018Tyrus, and someumes into Sarra. Tyre was unsuccessfilly besieged for five Years by\nShalmaneser. It was also besieged for thrten years by Nebuchadnezzar, and in the end an\nalliance was formed, by which the Tyrians retained their own king asa vassal of the king of\nBabylon. This arrangement was continued under the kings of Persia,\n\n296 Cwtius (iv. 7) tells us thatthe envoys also brought to Alexander a golden wreath,\ntogether with abundant supplies for his army\n\n207 This king must have brought home his ships for the defence of Tyre, for he was in\nthe city when it was captured. See chap. 24\n\n208 The Phoenician god Melkarth (lord of the city), whom the Syrians called Baal\n(lord), was supposed to be identical with the Grecian Heracles, or Hercules, who was the\nmythical ancestor of the Macedonian kings. Cutus (iv. 7) tells us that Alexander affirmed\nhe had been ordered by an oracle to sacrifice in Tyre to Heracles. Gesenius informs us that a\n\u201cMaltese inscription identifies the Tyrian Meikarth with Heracles,\n\n209 Who was the son of Labdacus.\n\n300 See Herodonus, ii. 43, 44\n\n301 The district comprising ll the south-west of Spain ouside the pillars of Heracles, or\nSwaits of Gibraltar, was called Tartesis, of which the chief ity was Tartessus.

The\nHebrew name fr ths region is Tarshish, of which Tatessus isthe Greek form. Tashish was\nthe station for the Phoenician trade withthe West, which extended as far as Cornwall. The\nTyrians fetched from this locality silver, ro, lead, tn, and gold (Isa xii. 1,6, 10, lev. 19;\nJer. x. 9; Ezck. xi, 12, xxwvitl. 13), Marial, Seneca, and Avienus, the fist two of whom\nwere Spaniards, understood Taressus o stand forthe south-west of Spain and Portugal.

No one at all acquainted with this work of Arians can\nrefuse his asset tothe epinion of Photius (p. 73; comp. Lucian, Alex, 2), that Arvian was\nthe best among the numerous historians of Alexander. One ofthe grt merits of the work,\nindependent of those already mentioned, is the cleamess and distintness with which he\ndescribes all military movements and operations, the drawing up of the armies for battle,\nand the conduct of battles and sieges. In all these respects the Anabasis is a mastcry\nproduction, and Arvian shows that he himself possessed a thorough practical knowledge of\nnilitary aflairs. He seldom introduces speeches, but wherever he does he shows a profound\nknowledge of man; and the speech of Alexander to his rebellious soldiers, andthe reply of\n\u2018Cocaus, as well a5 some other speeches, are masterly specimens of oratory.
